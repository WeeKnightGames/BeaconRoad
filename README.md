# Beacon Road Core Rules

Come play **Beacon Road**; a d20, dice-filled, action-adventure, heroic fantasy RPG suffused with player agency that incorporates tactical combat, jumping into the action, flashbacks, and minimal planning.

[The core rules](CoreRules.md) are currently under development and playtest.

[The design goals](DesignGoals.md) give a feel for where I want **Beacon Road** to go, and [the todo](Todo.md) gives the plan for getting there.

Also, [those who have contributed](Contributors.md) and [the license](License.md) are available.
