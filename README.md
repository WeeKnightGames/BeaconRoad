# Beacon Road Core Rules

Come play *Beacon Road*; a d20, dice-filled, action-adventure, heroic fantasy RPG suffused with player agency that incorporates tactical combat, jumping into the action, flashbacks, and minimal planning.

[The core rules](CoreRules.md) are currently under development and playtest.

[The design goals](DesignGoals.md) give a feel for where I want *Beacon Road* to go, and [the todo](Todo.md) gives the plan for getting there, and [the changes along the way](Changes.md) detail how close I am.

Also, [those who have contributed](Contributors.md) and [the license](License.md) are available.
