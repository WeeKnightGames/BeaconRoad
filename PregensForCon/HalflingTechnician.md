- Special Abilities:
    - Oath of Veracity. To lie you must take 1 Stress. If you break your word, take 1 Stress. When you Gather Information, gain Advantage when attempting to discern the truth or to detect lies.
        - You vow to always tell the truth and to follow through on whatever you say. You become supernaturally aware of other's lies.
    - Infiltrator. You are not affected by quality or Tier when you bypass security measures.
        - This ability lets you contend with higher-Tier enemies on equal footing. When you're cracking a safe, picking a lock, or sneaking past elite guards, your effect level is never reduced due to superior Tier or quality level of your opposition.
        - Are you a renowned safe cracker? Do people tell stories of how you slipped under the noses of two Chief Inspectors, or are your exceptional talents yet to be discovered?
    - Alchemist. When you invent or craft a creation with alchemical features, get +1 quality level to your roll. You begin with one special formula already known.
        - Follow the Inventing procedure with the GM to define your first special alchemical formula.
