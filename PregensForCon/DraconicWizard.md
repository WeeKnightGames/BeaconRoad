- Special Abilities:
    - Oath of Veracity. To lie you must take 1 Stress. If you break your word, take 1 Stress. When you Gather Information, gain Advantage when attempting to discern the truth or to detect lies.
        - You vow to always tell the truth and to follow through on whatever you say. You become supernaturally aware of other's lies.
    - Elemental Affinity (Entropic). You may expend one Powers Box to negate one consequence from an attack of a single damage type, or to Push Yourself to breathe destructive energy.
        - What element do you breathe? What elements do you have an affinity for? What elements are you vulnerable to?
        - When you use this ability, tick one Powers Box on your character sheet. If you negate a consequence, you ignore it completely. If you use this ability to Push Yourself, you get one of the benefits (Advantage or additional effect die), but you don't take Stress. Your special armor is restored at the beginning of downtime.
        - Elemental Breath
            - Prerequisites: Elemental Affinity.
            - Cost: Act, 1 Special Box.

    - Spellcraft. You know the arcane methods to conjure supernatural effects from written spells. You can Study a spell (or create a new one) to summon a supernatural effect. You begin with one spell already learned.
        - Without this special ability, written spells are only words on a page.
        - Follow the Spell Creation procedure with the GM to define your first spell.
        - The Stress cost of any spells you cast is lowered by the action rating of the casting action - a 6 Stress power would cost a character with Utter 2 only 4 Stress.
