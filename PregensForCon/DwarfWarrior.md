- Special Abilities:
    - Oath of Veracity. To lie you must take 1 Stress. If you break your word, take 1 Stress. When you Gather Information, gain Advantage when attempting to discern the truth or to detect lies.
        - You vow to always tell the truth and to follow through on whatever you say. You become supernaturally aware of other's lies.
    - Bodyguard. When you protect a teammate, gain Advantage on your resistance roll. When you gather info to anticipate possible threats in the current situation, you get +1 effect.
        - The protect teamwork maneuver lets you face a consequence for a teammate. If you choose to resist that consequence, this ability gives you Advantage on your resistance roll. Also, when you read a situation to Gather Information about hidden dangers or potential attackers, you get +1 effect-which means more detailed information.
    - Strapping. Your load limits are higher, and you are not slowed by your load. Light: 5. Normal: 7. Heavy: 8.
        - Dwarves make Mules look like weaklings.
        - This ability is great if you want to wear heavy armor and pack a heavy weapon without attracting lots of attention. Since your exact gear is determined on-the-fly during an operation, having more load also gives you more options to get creative with when dealing with problems during a score.
