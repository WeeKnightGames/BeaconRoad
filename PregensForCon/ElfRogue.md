- Special Abilities:
    - Oath of Veracity. To lie you must take 1 Stress. If you break your word, take 1 Stress. When you Gather Information, gain Advantage when attempting to discern the truth or to detect lies.
        - You vow to always tell the truth and to follow through on whatever you say. You become supernaturally aware of other's lies.
    - Reflexes. When there's a question about who acts first, the answer is you.
        - You may choose to act cautiously in combat, but if an enemy would attempt to act against you, you may take your turn before they do.
        - This ability gives you the initiative in most situations. Some specially trained NPCs might also have reflexes, but otherwise, you're always the first to act, and can interrupt anyone else who tries to beat you to the punch. This ability usually doesn't negate the need to make an action roll that you would otherwise have to make, but it may improve your position or effect.
    - Sharpshooter. You do not suffer DisAdvantage when making ranged weapon attacks at distances beyond their first range increment. You can Push Yourself to do one of the following: make a ranged attack at extreme distance beyond what's normal for the weapon---unleash a barrage of rapid fire to suppress the enemy.
        - When you Push Yourself to activate this ability, you still get one of the normal benefits of pushing yourself (Advantage, +1 effect, etc.) in addition to the special ability.
