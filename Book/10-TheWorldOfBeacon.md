# Chapter 1: The World of Beacon

**Ladies and gentlemen, gods and monsters,**

On the world of Esgyrn, the continent of Amehratus, we find the city of Beacon - the light of civilization, hope of the world, and bastion against the encroaching darkness and wilderness.

The city of Beacon is ruled by Kyriel Eliarchus Dominatu the Twenty-First---Zenith of Metahumanity, Capstone of Hope, Bastion of Civilization, Defender of the Weak, Conqueror of the Wilds, Promissory of Respite from the Encroaching Dark, Last King of the Tribes of Midnight, and the Spirit-Queen-Incarnate of the Great Metropolis-State of Beacon. Beacon is the greatest city the worlds have ever seen. It sits atop a bluff nearly a mile high and over 30 miles across. Districts divide the city into independent areas that operate independently with completely different architecture. One district is tall gleaming towers of silver, gold, and white. Another looks like it is grown from trees and is covered in wheat fields growing across the tops of buildings and in berry patches cascading down the side of trees and vibrant, verdant life. Another is squat stone buildings with fires and smoke and the constant clang of machinery and smithing pouring out of them. Another looks to be in perpetual dusk, every building dark and brooding. Another with tall, square utilitarian buildings and factories.

Esgyrn has 2 significant moons: Lua orbiting in a roughly circular orbit every 30 days, and Graig orbiting along a near polar, highly elliptic orbit.

Esgyrn is intended to be treated like a sandbox---some of the pieces in the world are intended to be fixed structures (at least from the perspective of this book) while other pieces are intended to be molded by the players.
