## Encounters

There are three main kinds of encounters: combat, skill, and social. An encounter can move between the different kinds depending on the character choices or can encompass 2 or 3 different kinds at once. A simple, less important, or less interesting encounter can be resolved with a single roll and appropriate narration. A somewhat more important encounter can be resolved by having the characters Act Together---with each character narrating their actions. More interesting or more important encounters should be resolved using the full encounter rules below.

## Skill Encounters

A **Skill Encounter** involves the characters using their skills to overcome obstacles and challenges in the world. This can involve things like sneaking past guards into a castle, navigating treacherous mountains and jungles, chasing a criminal through a city, or constructing a fortification. A *skill encounter* involves characters making skill checks and moving closer to their goal until either they complete the challenge, their time runs out, or they fail in a way that gives them another path to follow.

A character can either Act Alone or Act Together. Acting Alone would be something like a character picking a lock, remembering a crucial bit of information, or interrogating a bystander. The success or failure of this action is entirely determined by the success or failure of that character's check. Acting Together might be something like making your way through a crowd, sneaking across a courtyard, or navigating your way through a maze.

## Social Encounters

A **Social Encounter** revolves around characters talking, posturing, commiserating, and otherwise interacting socially. At the beginning of a social encounter, each side of the disagreement states their desired result to the GM. If the players and the GM agree to the possible consequences, the encounter proceeds. The GM then assigns each side of the disagreement a clock that when filled represents that side winning. Each side takes turns making appropriate skill checks (usually **Command**, **Consort**, and **Sway**) to convince the other side of the usefulness of their goal. Each Success advances the clock that side. A Failure gives the other side +1 Tier on their next argument. A Botch ticks clock segments for the other side. A Critical ticks additional clock segments based on the Critical Multiplier.

When one side of an argument completes their goal, they have won the argument and achieve their stated goals. Any other sides with ticked clocks achieve some of their goals, requiring concessions from the winning side.
