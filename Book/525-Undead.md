### Psuedolich

A psuedolich is the result of a botched attempt to become a lich. Should an individual fail to create a phylactery while attempting to acheive lichdom, their soul begins to seep from their body, dissipating into oblivion. Many die this way, but the most prepared fashion an artificial skull to bind their soul to their body. The departing soul is then kept in place and a new body grows around the artificial skull. When a psuedolich is killed, their body is consumed---with the artificial skull and their actual skull switching places---replaced by the artificial skull, and they wake up in the artificially grown body. Should their binding skull be destroyed, their soul begins again to leach from their body; and a new artificial skull must be created to stem the loss. The more of a psuedolich's soul escapes, the less sane and less human they become. Few psuedoliches survive the absence of a binding skull for more than 7 days.
