12. The Slums

    * Description
    * Landmarks
        * The Weeping Nurse
            * A slummy, ramshackle, 3 story tavern with a decades old "Under New Management" sign hanging out front. Run by a corpulent, weary man named Barbados. The best place to find criminal and adventuring work in the district.
    * Scene
        * Narrow, shadowed, filthy streets. Walled and guarded enclaves. Obvious thugs standing outside nondescript doors. Street urchins chasing each other and lifting coin off drunk bodies.
    * Streets
        * Main Street, Beggar's Alley, Broken Way.
    * Buildings
        * Squalid tenements. Abandoned three-story houses covered in grime. Dilapidated, two-story wood storefronts.

13. Trellis

    * Description
    * Landmarks
        * The Floating Gardens.
            * The central draw of Trellis. A large garden with dozens of boulders, rocks, and small mountains magically suspended in the air with wondrous trees, plants, flowers, and bushes growing between them above the most immaculate lawn.
        * Audubon Fair.
            * A wide street that winds its way through Trellis providing space for the only open air market in the district. Only reputable merchants are allowed to sell here.
        * Donnister and Sons.
            * A clothier, tailor, and store.
        * Rose and Orchid.
            * The currently popular cafe and winery.
    * Scene
        * A couple enjoying a stroll along white streets. Kids racing through the gardens in games of tag. Gentry in harnessed carriages making their way to other estates. Lords and ladies discussing politics, fashion, and the latest developments sitting at terraced cafes.
    * Streets
        * Wide, well kept, white paved stone streets. Audubon Fair, Eucalyptus Way, Rose Street, Lesterham Pass.
    * Buildings
        * Tall manor homes. Multi story brick businesses. Ivy covered stone buildings. Second and third floor patios.
    * Notables
        * Ser Donnister
            * A well respected local tailor whose latest designs adorn the lords and ladies of Trellis. He provides clothing for some of the poor in the Waning Lawn. Honest, respectable, fair.
        * Lady Macabre
            * A lady who influences the trends and fashions of Trellis. Her true identity is unknown. She is rumored to own many of the nobles across Beacon. Cunning, strange, mysterious.
        * Gardener Regent
            * A title given to the individual responsible for maintaining the Floating Gardens and the streets of Trellis. Currently a young, unmarried woman - Daevin Arboritum (Visionary, inspiring, cautious.) - without apparent claims to nobility.
        * Lord Baxton, Baron of Trellis
            * A local noble whose family has been a fixture in the aristocracy of Trellis for centuries and in Beacon for longer. Never awarded the highest titles and lands, but constant across kings, queens, and regimes. A patron of the arts and adventurers. Patient, connected, noble.
