## Stress

Characters have a special reserve called **Stress**. A character starts with 10 maximum Stress and may not get more than 12 maximum Stress

When you suffer a consequence that you don't want to accept, you can take Stress instead. The result of the **Resistance Roll** determines how much Stress it costs to avoid a bad outcome.

## Pushing Yourself

You can use Stress to **Push Yourself** for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, take **1 Stress** (each can be chosen once for a given action):

* Gain **+1 Tier** on an Action Roll.
* Roll **+1 Effect Die**.
* Take action while *Slowed* or *Stunned*.

## Heroic Blessings

The characters are not normal and so can tap into heroic blessings that enable them to perform nigh-supernatural exploits. Heroic blessings are not related to Bloodline, Archetype, or Chapter. They are benefits that any player can use. Heroic blessings are represented with **Beacon Points** that a player can spend to activate a blessing. Beacon Points may be spent:

* To avoid death.
* To Act or React an additional time per round.
* To reroll with Advantage a failed roll.
* To trigger a flashback.
* Instead of taking some amount of Stress (not covered in the above).

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
