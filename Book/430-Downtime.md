# Downtime

After the Chapter finishes an Adventure (succeed or fail), they take time to recover, regroup, and prepare for the next. This phase of the game is called **Downtime**.

Downtime fulfills two purposes in the game:

* First, it's a break for the players. During the action of an Adventure, the Characters are always under threat, charging from obstacle to obstacle in a high-energy sequence. Downtime gives them a reprieve so they can catch their breath and relax a bit---focus on lower-energy, quieter elements of the game, as well as explore personal aspects of their Characters.
* Second, the shift into a new phase of the game signals a shift in which mechanics are needed. There are special rules that are only used during Downtime, so they're kept "out of the way" during the other parts of play. When we shift into downtime, we take out a different toolbox and resolve downtime on its own terms, then shift back into the more action-focused phases of the game afterwards.

Downtime is divided into 2 parts, which are resolved in order:

1. **Payoff**. The Chapter receives rewards from a successfully completed Adventure.
2. **Downtime Work**. The Characters Exemplify their Virtues and Indulge their Vices to remove Stress, work on long-term projects, recover from injuries, etc.

After the downtime activities are resolved, the game returns to free play, and the group can move toward their next Adventure.

## Payoff

After an Adventure, the Characters take stock of their income from the operation. A successful Adventure generates both Rep and Coin.

The Chapter earns 2 Rep per Adventure by default. If the target of the Adventure is higher Tier than you, take **+1 Rep per Tier higher**. If the target of the Adventure is lower Tier, you get **-1 Rep per Tier lower** (minimum zero).

If your Chapter is Tier I and you pull off a successful Adventure against a Tier III target, you earn 4 Rep (2 Rep, +2 Rep for a target two Tiers above you). If your Chapter is Tier III and you complete a Adventure against a Tier I target, you earn 0 Rep (2 Rep, -2 Rep for the lower Tier target).

If you keep the operation completely quiet so no one knows about it, you earn zero Rep. Mark the Rep on the Rep tracker on the Chapter sheet.

The Chapter earns Coin based on the nature of the operation and/or any loot they seized:

* **2 Coin**: A minor job; several full purses.
* **4 Coin**: A small job; a strongbox.
* **6 Coin**: A standard Adventure; decent loot.
* **8 Coin**: A big Adventure; serious loot.
* **10+ Coin**: A major Adventure; impressive loot.

Record the Coin on the Chapter sheet, or divvy it up among the Chapter members as you see fit.

GM, definitely don't screw around with the players when it comes to the payoff. Don't say that the client lied and there's no reward. Or that the meeting for the payment is actually a trap, or whatever. The Characters have enough problems coming at them from every direction already. When it comes to getting paid, just give them what they earned.

## Downtime Work

Between Adventures, your Chapter spends time at their liberty, attending to personal needs and side projects. These are called **Downtime Activities** (see the list below). Each Character may **Work twice during Downtime**. *When you're at war, each Character has time for only one.*

* Acquire Asset
* Long-Term Project
* Healing and Recovery
* Train
* Exemplify Virtue
* Indulge Vice

You may choose to Work on any Activity more than once. You can only Work on Activities you're in a position to accomplish. If an Activity is contingent on other Work, resolve that Work first.

A Character can Work more than twice per Downtime, at a cost. **Each additional Activity from the list costs 1 Coin or 1 Rep**. This reflects the time and resulting resource drain while you're "off the clock" and not earning from a Adventure. When you complete a new Adventure, you reset and get two "free" Activities again.

Activities on the Downtime list are limited; normal activities are not. During Downtime, you can still go places, do things, make Action Rolls, Gather Information, talk with other characters, etc. In other words, only Activities that are *on the list* are limited.

For any Downtime Activity, gain **Advantage** on the roll if a **friend** or **contact** helps you. After the roll, you may spend Coin to improve the Result Level. **Increase the Result Level by 1 for each Coin spent**. So, a Failure becomes a Success, a Success becomes a Critical, and a Critical increases its multiplier by one.

* GM: If a player can't decide which Downtime Activity to pick, offer them a Long-Term Project idea. You know what the player is interested in and what they like. Suggest a project that will head in a fun direction for them.
* "Remember how you had that weird vision at the altar to the forgotten gods? Yeah, do you want to get to the bottom of that? Okay, start a Long-Term Project---6 Segments---called... ‘Weird God Vibes.' What do you do to work on that?"

## Acquire Asset

Gain temporary use of an **Asset**:

* One special **Item** or set of common items (enough for a gang of your Tier scale).
* A **Cohort** (an expert or gang).
* A **Vehicle**.
* A **Service**. Transport from a smuggler or driver, use of a warehouse for temporary storage, legal representation, etc.

"Temporary use" constitutes one significant period of usage that makes sense for the Asset---typically the duration of one Adventure. An Asset may also be acquired for "standby" use in the future. You might hire a gang to guard your lair, for example, and they'll stick around until after the first serious battle, or until a week goes by, and they lose interest.

To acquire the Asset, make an Action Roll versus a **Controlled** (6), **Risky** (11), or **Desperate** (16) target number. The result indicates the **Quality** of the Asset you get, using the Chapter's Tier as the base. A **Failure** is Tier - 1; a **Success** is Tier, and a **Critical** is Tier + *Critical multiplier*. You can spend Coin to raise the result of this roll by spending **2** Coin per additional Tier level added.

The GM may set a **minimum quality** level that must be achieved to acquire a particular Asset. For example, if you want to get a set of military uniforms and masks, you'd need to acquire a Tier IV Asset. A lower result won't do.

If you acquire the same Asset again, you gain **Advantage** on your roll. If you continue to re-acquire an Asset every time it's used, you can effectively rent it indefinitely.

Alchemicals, poisons, bombs, and dangerous gadgets are highly restricted. When you acquire one of these items (rather than crafting it yourself), you'll need to p

If you want to acquire an Asset permanently, you can either gain it as a Chapter Upgrade or work on it as a **Long-Term Project** to set up a permanent acquisition.

* Zibiah is an accomplished duelist and would like a fine sword to add to her permanent items. Her player starts a Long-Term Project: "Get My Family Sword Back from the Pawn Shop." The GM says this is an 8--clock (she can work on it by Consorting or Swaying the pawn shop owner or maybe rolling her lifestyle level to represent small payments).

## Long-Term Project

When you work on a Long-Term Project (either a brand new one, or an already existing one), describe what your character does to advance the Project Clock, and make an Action Roll versus a **Controlled** (6), **Risky** (11), or **Desperate** (16) target number. Mark Segments on the clock according to your result: **Failure**: 1 Segment, **Success**: 2 Segments, **Critical**: 2 Segments + *Critical multiplier*.

A Long-Term Project can cover a wide variety of activities, like doing research into an arcane ritual, investigating a mystery, establishing someone's trust, courting a new friend or contact, changing your character's vice, and so on.

Based on the goal of the project, the GM will tell you the Clock(s) to create and suggest a method by which you might make progress.

In order to work on a project, you might first have to achieve the means to pursue it---which can be a project in itself. For example, you might want to make friends with a member of the City Council, but you have no connection to them. You could first work on a project to Consort in their circles so you have the opportunity to meet one of them. Once that's accomplished, you could start a new project to form a friendly relationship.

## Healing and Recovery

Recovery from injury comes in 2 different forms:

1. During Downtime, you can expend 1 Stress to Recover (regaining one-quarter of your maximum HP).
2. You can spend a Downtime Activity seeking treatment and healing injury. You might visit a physician who can stitch your wounds and soothe your mind with anatomical science or a witch who specializes in healing charms and restorative alchemy. If you don't have a contact or fellow Character who can provide treatment, you can use the **Acquire Asset** activity to gain access to a healer, who can provide service for the whole Chapter.

Your healer rolls (perhaps **Utter** or **Craft** for a Character with the healing special ability, or the **Quality Level** of an NPC) versus a **Risky** (11) target number and then you Recover based on the roll: **Failure**: Recover 1×, **Success**: Recover 2×, **Critical**: Recover 2× + *Critical multiplier*.

You may heal yourself by rolling against a **Desperate** (16) target number, but you take 2 stress when you do so. You can also choose to simply tough it out and attempt to heal without any treatment---in this case, take 1 stress and suffer Disadvantage on the Action Roll.

Note that it's the recovering Character that takes the Recovery Activity. Healing someone else does not cost a Downtime Activity for the healer.

## Train

When you spend time in training, **mark 1 XP** on the XP track for an **Attribute** or **Self** advancement. If you have the appropriate Chapter Training upgrade unlocked, mark **+1 XP** (2 total). See **Chapter Upgrades**, page XX.

> You can train a given XP track only once per downtime.

## Exemplify Virtue or Indulge Vice

Go out into the world to exercise and exemplify your **Virtue** to relieve **Stress**. Or visit your **Vice Purveyor** to relieve **Stress**.

## Virtue Roll

* Roll [d6].

Clear Stress equal to your roll.

## Vice Roll

* Roll [d10].

Clear Stress equal to your roll. If you clear more Stress boxes than you had marked, you **Overindulge**.

## Stress Relief

Your characters are a special lot. They defy the powers-that-be and dare to prey on those who are considered to be their betters. They push themselves further than ordinary people are willing to go. But this comes at a cost. Their life is one of constant stress. Often they turn to their innate strength and virtue to release stress. But far too often, each turns to the seduction of a **Vice** in order to cope.

A character's Virtue is their healthiest way to deal with chaos in life and to try to make the world a better place. With this comes relief from stress and the ability to once again face the overwhelming challenge of their daring life. A character's Vice is their obsession. But with this indulgence comes relief from stress and the ability to once again face the overwhelming challenge of their daring life.

## Exemplifying Your Virtue

When you exemplify your vice, you clear some stress from your character's stress track. Say how your character exemplifies their virtue. This takes time, so it can only be done when the Chapter has **Downtime**. Alternately, you may choose to release your character to be "characterizing their virture" during a game session, allowing them to indulge off-camera while you play a different character. A gang member, friend, or contact of the Chapter might be created as an alternate character to play, thus fleshing out the landscape of Characters.

## Indulging Your Vice

When you indulge your vice, you clear some stress from your character's stress track. Say how your character indulges their vice, including which **purveyor of vice** they use to satisfy their needs. This indulgence takes time, so it can only be done when the Chapter has **Downtime**. Alternately, you may choose to release your character to be "lost in their vice" during a game session, allowing them to indulge off-camera while you play a different character. A gang member, friend, or contact of the Chapter might be created as an alternate character to play, thus fleshing out the landscape of Characters.

## Overindulgence

If your vice roll clears more stress levels than you had marked, you overindulge. A vice is not a reliable, controllable habit. It's a risk---and one that can drive your character to act against their own best interests.

When you overindulge, you make a bad call because of your vice---in acquiring it or while under its influence. To bring the effect of this bad decision into the game, select an overindulgence from the list:

* **Attract Trouble.** Select or roll an additional **entanglement**.
* **Brag about your exploits.** **+2** heat.
* **Lost.** Your character vanishes for a few weeks. Play a different character until this one returns from their bender. When your character returns, they've also healed any harm they had.
* **Tapped.** Your current purveyor cuts you off. Find a new source for your vice.

### Roleplaying & XP

Along with your character's heritage and background, their vice tells us what kind of person they are. This obsession impacts their motivations, goals, and behavior. When you ponder what your character might do or say next, you can always consider their vice to help you think of something. As an added benefit, by playing to the nature of your character's vice, you earn XP at the end of the session.

## Downtime Activities in Play

## NPC & faction downtime

NPCs and factions also do things when the Characters have downtime. The GM **advances their project clocks** and chooses a downtime maneuver or two for each faction that they're interested in at the moment. Choose any maneuver that makes sense for that faction to pursue. For example:

* Seize a claim or increase hold, make an enemy vulnerable, or reduce the hold of a vulnerable enemy.
* Gather information on the Characters (may be opposed by a Character roll) or another subject.
* Achieve a short-term goal they're in position to accomplish.
* Acquire a new Asset.
* Call in a favor from another faction.
* Employ political pressure or threats to force someone's hand.

**GM:** Choose downtime maneuvers and advance clocks for the factions you're interested in right now. Don't worry about the rest. Later, when you turn your attention to a faction you've ignored for a while, go ahead and give them several downtime phases and project clock ticks to "catch up" to current events.

If you're not sure how far to progress a faction's clock, make a fortune roll using their Tier as the base trait, modified up or down depending on the opposition or circumstances. Given **Failure**: tick 1 Segment, **Success**: tick 2 Segments, **Critical**: tick 2 Segments + Critical multiplier.

When factions do things that are known in the criminal underworld, **tell the players about it** through one of their **friends** or **contacts** or **vice purveyors**. These rumors and bits of gossip can lead to future scores and opportunities for the Characters.
