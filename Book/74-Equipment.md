# Appendix D: Designs & Equipment

The rarity listed in an item or design's description is the most commonly  it can be found. For example, "uncommon heavy armor" cannot likely be found at a small town blacksmith.

* A **common** design, formula, item, or material is available during character creation and is available for purchase in most locations.
* An **uncommon** design, formula, item, or material is not available during character creation and is probably not purchasable in smaller or more remote locations. This increases its *minimum quality* by 1 when crafting.
* A **rare** design, formula, item, or material is not available during character creation and may not be purchasable in most locations, even large cities. This increases its *minimum quality* by 2 when crafting.
* A **unique** design, formula, item, or material is not available during character creation, is 1 of a kind, and is essentially never purchasable or sellable. This increases its *minimum quality* by 3 when crafting.

Designs and equipment may have various rules, advantages, or drawbacks.

* An **agile** weapon is small and simple enough to use in your off-hand and suffers -1 Tier when used to **Skirmish**.
* An **armor piercing** weapon or attack requires an additional Soak Box to ignore damage or effects from.
* An **augment** improves the capability of a given weapon. Only 1 *augment* may be active on a weapon at a single time.
* A **complex** item must be created in multiple stages; the GM will tell you how many. At least 1 downtime activity and crafting roll is needed per stage; possibly a clock per stage.
* A **cumbersome** item can be used only once per round, and no other items can be used in the same round.
* A **conspicuous** item and its use don't go unnoticed. Its use makes those around immediately aware.
* A **consumable** item or creation has a limited number of uses (all alchemicals must have this drawback, usually 1 use).
* A **defensive** item increases your Iron by 1.
* A **melee** [range] item may be used to take actions against targets up to [range]' away from you. While wielding a melee weapon and able to act, you threaten enemies within the listed range.
* A **powerful** weapon may not be used by creatures smaller than intended and suffers -1 Tier when used to **Finesse**.
* A **ranged** [range] item may be used to take actions against targets up to [range]' away from you. At up to twice the range, those actions suffer -1 Tier. Beyond that, actions cannot target. A ranged item takes 2 hands to reload even if it can be used with 1 hand.
* You must Act to reload an item with **reload** (instead of reloading as part of using it).
* An **unreliable** item may fail when used, make a **fortune roll** (using its **quality**) to see how well it performs.
* A **volatile** item produces a dangerous or troublesome side-effect for the user, specified by the GM (see examples on the sample creations, page XX). A side-effect is a consequence, often targeting the defenses of you or adjacent creatures.
* A **well-made** item takes 1 less Load Box.

## Armor & Shields

| Name         | Soak Boxes | Load | Rarity   | Tags |
|--------------|------------|------|----------|------|
| Light Armor  | 2          | 2    | Common   | |
| Medium Armor | 4          | 4    | Common   | |
| Heavy Armor  | 6          | 5    | Uncommon | |
| Exosuit      | 8          | 6    | Rare     | |
| Light Shield | 2          | 1    | Common   | Defensive |
| Heavy Shield | 4          | 2    | Common   | Defensive |

* Soak Boxes can be checked to reduce damage taken by 10.

* **Light Armor** provides a small amount of protection while remaining thin and supple enough to avoid restricting movement. Leather is an example of light armor.
* **Medium armor** provides more protection than light armor but may restrict movement and may slow wearers down through its extra weight. Hide and chain mail are examples of medium armor.
* **Heavy armor** is predominantly built from metal and provides a lot of protection but weighs the most and may slow wearers down simply through its bulk. Plate is an example of heavy armor.
* An **exosuit** is a large and heavy enough set of armor that it requires its own power source to wear it, but it provides the most protection. Exoplate is an example of an exosuit.
* A **light shield** can be used to deflect attacks and projectiles without too much encumbrance.
* A **heavy shield** is a more efficient defensive tool than a light shield.

## Weaponry

The below weapons are for medium-sized creatures. A large-sized creature increases the effect die by 1 size and the melee range 5'. A medium-sized creature using a large-sized weapon treats it as one increment larger; for example, a human attempting to wield a large-sized longsword would treat it as a medium-sized greatsword. A medium-sized creature cannot wield a large-sized weapon of the largest size. The reverse of the above applies for small-sized creatures. A small-sized dagger has a [d4] effect die. The range of melee weapons for small-sized creatures is the half of the range of medium-sized weapons.
