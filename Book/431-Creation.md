# Learning and Creating Rituals and Spells

To enact a ritual is to come into contact with abyssal and cosmic forces and entreat them to do your will. It is a practice not without considerable risk. To cast a spell is to project your studied transformation onto reality. Rituals and spells are two sides of the same coin. The time needed to learn a ritual or spell requires downtime---often in the form of long-term projects.

## Finding a ritual or spell source

A character with the Ritual special ability begins with 1 known ritual, already learned (answer the questions below to create it, or select one from the list in Appendix XX on page XX); while a character with the Spellcraft or the Bargain special ability begins with 1 known spell---in addition to other starting powers---already learned (answer the questions below to create it, or look in Appendix XX on page XX). To learn a new ritual or spell, a Character must first find a **source**. A source may be secured as payoff from an adventure---perhaps you steal a ritual or spell book when your crew robs the Ancients Wing of a Library. You might also secure a source as the goal of a long-term project---by consorting with cultist friends, studying ancient texts, or some other method you devise.

## Learning a ritual or spell

Once the source of a ritual or spell is found, you may undertake a long-term project to learn the ritual. Most rituals and spells will require an 8-segment progress clock to learn. The player and the GM answer questions about the ritual or spell to define what it will do in play and what is required to perform it (see below). The player records these answers in their notes for future reference.

### Ritual Questions

1. GM asks: **"What does the ritual or spell do, how is it weird, and what is its name?"** Player answers.
2. Player asks: **"What must I do to perform the ritual or to cast the spell, and what is its price?"** GM answers.

    * A ritual takes at least one downtime activity to perform and inflicts **stress** on the caster according to its **magnitude** (detailed on page XX). If performance of the ritual is dangerous or troublesome in some way, it requires an action roll (usually Utter). A ritual may also have additional costs, such as a sacrifice, rare item, the start of a dire progress clock, etc.
    * You must Act or React to cast a spell and it inflicts **stress** on the caster according to its **magnitude**. If performance of the spell is dangerous or troublesome in some way, it requires an Action Roll (usually Utter). A damaging spell requires an attack roll against each targeted entity. A spell may also have additional costs, such as a sacrifice, rare item, the start of a dire progress clock, etc.

3. GM asks: **"What new belief, fear, or question does knowledge of this ritual or spell and its attendant arcane forces instill in you?"** Player answers.

### Example Ritual Answers

* *Player: "The ritual wards a person so that the ghosts of their victims cannot find them. It's weird because... as long as the ward is in place, the person sometimes weeps tears of black blood."*
* *GM: "Spend a downtime action to prepare a mixture of tobacco, dream smoke, and crematory ash from a victim---which the target then smokes. You take at least 3 stress when you perform the ritual, which will be its quality for a fortune roll when it's challenged by a spirit-so you might want to take more stress to make it more potent."*
* *Player: "Gotcha. My new fear is what will happen if the spirits figure out where the ward came from and turn their vengeance on me, instead."*

### Example Spell Answers

* *Player: "The spell, called Fireball, creates a bead of energy that shoots from the caster's hand and explodes at a location in range."*
* *GM: "Spend an Action and suffer 5 stress to cast Fireball. It explodes in a 25' cube within 100'. Make an attack roll (UTTER! vs Iron) against each creature in the cube. Each creature hit suffers (1 + Utter)[d8] Thermal damage. The range of the spell doesn't contribute its normal cost due to your expertise with fire."*
* *Player: "I wonder why this spell has been hidden in this book for so long. And why was its text encrypted?"*

## Performing a Ritual

To perform a ritual, you must have the Ritual special ability, then follow the method outlined by the answers to the ritual questions. Most rituals will take **1 downtime activity** to complete, though the GM may call for two (or more) downtime activities for very powerful or far-reaching rituals. Some rituals may be partially performed during downtime and then fully manifested at-will later by completing the last incantation or ritual action. In this case, simply make a note that the ritual has been "primed" and may be unleashed at a later time.

When you perform a ritual, you take an amount of **stress** as established by the ritual questions, according to the **magnitude** of the forces brought to bear. The GM uses magnitude as a *guideline* for setting the stress cost---it may be higher or lower at their discretion to better describe the nature of the ritual. Some claims and special abilities also reduce the stress cost for ritual casting.

**Rituals take time to cast.** Use the duration examples on the magnitude table to reduce the stress cost based on the time needed, generally no less than an hour.

The GM may also **tick a progress clock** when you perform a ritual---to advance the agenda of an arcane power or entity, or to show the steady approach of a dark outcome that is a consequence of the ritual's use.

If a ritual is dangerous or troublesome to perform, make an **action roll** (usually Utter) to see if unpleasant consequences manifest. If a ritual has an uncertain effect then a **fortune roll** should be made to see how well it manifests. Because a ritual is a downtime activity, you may spend coin 1-for-1 to increase the result level of your fortune roll (this represents the expenditure of expensive or rare ritual materials). If a ritual is both dangerous and uncertain, then both rolls may be called for.

Each performance of a ritual is a unique event, and may not always work the same way each time. The GM or players may call for a round of questions to establish a ritual anew. Rituals are a way to bring in a wide variety of arcane effects into the game. Use with caution! If you ever go overboard, address the questions again to establish new weirdness and costs if things have gotten out of hand. The abyssal forces are not playthings and cannot be considered a reliable or safe source of power.


# Crafting and Modifying Items and Equipment

During downtime, a Character can Craft with special materials and tools to produce strange **alchemicals**, **build** (or **modify**) **items**, create **spark-craft** gadgets, or enchant **arcane** implements or weapons. The system for each method is similar, with different details depending on the nature of the project. The time needed to learn a new plan or to craft requires downtime---often in the form of long-term projects.

## Inventing

To invent a formula for a new alchemical concoction or the plan for a new item of your design, you need to Study it as a **long-term project**. Most new formulas or designs will require an 8-segment progress clock to invent and learn. The player and the GM answer questions about the invention to define what it will do in play and what is required to create it (see below). The player records these answers in their notes for future reference.

### Creation Questions

1. GM asks: **"What type of creation is it and what does it do?"** Player answers. A creation might be mundane, alchemical, arcane, or spark-craft. If a Character has an appropriate special ability (Alchemist, Artificer, Strange Methods), they get bonuses when inventing and crafting certain creation types.
2. Player asks: **"What's the minimum quality level of this item?"** GM answers, with the **magnitude** of the effects the item produces as a guideline.
3. GM asks: **"What rare, strange, or adverse aspect of this formula or design has kept it in obscurity, out of common usage?**" Player answers.
4. Player asks: **"What drawbacks does this item have, if any?"** GM answers by choosing one or more from the drawbacks list, or by saying there are none.

A Character with the Alchemist, Artificer, or Deep Artisan special abilities invents and learns one special formula when they take the ability (they don't have to take time to learn it).

Once you've invented a formula or design, you can **craft** it by using a downtime activity (see **Crafting**, below). No one else can craft this invention unless they learn your design as a long-term project. If you acquire a formula or design invented by another tinkerer, you may learn to craft it by completing a long-term project.

Common alchemicals (page XX) and ordinary items don't require special formulas or designs to learn. Anyone may attempt to craft them by using commonly available instructions.

## Crafting

### Crafting Roll

* Roll **CRAFT!** versus a **controlled** (6), **risky** (11), or **desperate** (16) target number, modified by Tier.
* **+1 quality** per **coin** spent.
* **+1 quality** for **Workshop** crew upgrade.
* **Critical:** Quality level is Tier + *critical multiplier*.
* **Success:** Quality level is Tier.
* **Failure:** Quality level is equal to Tier - 1.
* **Botch:** Quality level is 0. Additionally, either your ingredients are ruined; or the item has some other consequence, drawback, or hindrance.

To craft something, spend one **downtime activity** to make a **Craft** roll to determine the **quality level** of the item you produce. The base quality level is equal to your crew's Tier, modified by the result of the roll (see the results on the next page).

The results are based on your crew's Tier because it indicates the overall quality of the workspace and materials you have access to. *If you do the work with the **Workshop** upgrade for your crew, your effective Tier level is one higher for this roll.*

The GM sets a **minimum quality** level that must be achieved to craft the item, based on the **magnitude** of the effect(s) it produces. The GM uses magnitude as a *guideline* for setting the quality level---it may be higher or lower at their discretion to better describe the nature of the project. An item may be crafted at *higher* quality if the player wishes to attempt it.

You may spend coin 1-for-1 to increase the final quality level result of your roll (this can raise quality level beyond Tier + *critical multiplier*).

### Modifying an item

Adding a feature or additional function to an item is simpler than creating something new. You don't need to invent a special formula or plan. Make a crafting roll to modify an item (the baseline quality of an item that you modify is equal to your crew's Tier, as usual).

* A simple, useful modification requires Tier + 1 quality. *A rifle that breaks down into two sections to be more easily concealed.*
* A significant modification requires Tier + 2 quality. *Strengthening the barrel and powder load of a gun to fire further.*
* An arcane, spark-craft, or alchemical modification requires Tier + 3 or higher quality. *A dagger that can harm a demon. An electrified hull on a boat to repel boarders or ghosts. An outfit coated with chemicals to mask you from deathlands predators.*

Modified items, like special creations, may have **drawbacks**.

# Magnitude

Supernatural entities and energies have a wide variety of effects and power levels. To help the GM judge these forces consistently, the **magnitude** scale is provided. See the master table of magnitude at right. Magnitude measures the quality level of a ghost or demon or different aspects of an arcane force: its area, scale, duration, range, and force. Whenever you need to assess an entity or power, use the magnitude scale as a guideline to judge how it compares relative to the examples given on the table.

You can use the magnitude of an entity or power as a dice pool for a **fortune roll** to see how much effect it has, if it's not obvious or certain.

* *A sea demon summons a crushing wave at the canal dock where the PCs are landing their boat. How badly does this damage the vessel and the crew? Obviously it's gonna be bad for them, but are they merely sinking or are they immediately wrecked and sunk? The GM makes a fortune roll with **Advantage 6** (the magnitude of the demon) versus a risky TN of 17 (11 + 6). On a botch, the wave has only little effect (for a huge wave), causing the craft to take on water and begin sinking. On a failure, the wave has reduced effect, fully swamping the boat and throwing some of the characters and their cargo overboard. On a success, the wave has full effect, immediately sinking the boat and dragging the crew and cargo under. On a critical, the boat is sunk, and also the crew and cargo are badly harmed by flying debris and the crushing force of the wave.*

You can add levels of magnitude together to describe a combination of effects, or simply focus on one key feature for the magnitude assessment, ignoring other elements, even if they're on the magnitude scale. They're not *always* additive.

* *In the example above, the demon generated magnitude 6 force and the GM included its area of effect "for free" as part of the power. A huge wave at a dock should affect the boats and the crews there, in their judgment.*
* *In a different session, a Wizard wants to accomplish a ritual that will unleash a hurricane across the district. The GM says that this is a very significant effect, so they add two levels of magnitude together: force 6 and range 5. To create such a devastating power, the Wizard will suffer 11 stress! The GM offers a compromise: the ritual will take a few hours to complete, so the stress cost will be reduced to 8, but some people in the affected area may realize what's happening and flee before the full storm hits.*

The magnitude table is provided as a tool to help the GM make judgment calls. It's not meant to be a rigid restriction or mathematical formula to replace those judgment calls. Use the levels as a *guideline* for setting a magnitude number that seem appropriate to you.

This table can also be used as a guide to **quality level** when a PC **acquires an asset** or crafts an **alchemical** or **gadget**.
