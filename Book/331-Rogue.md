- Special Abilities
    - **Ambush.**
        - When you attack from hiding or spring a trap, you gain **Edge** on your roll.
            - This ability benefits from preparation---so don't forget you can do that in a flashback.
    - **Arcane Potency.**
        - You may imbue your hands, melee weapons, or tools with energy - allowing them to deal an additional damage type in addition to *kinetic* damage.
            - Your fists are now an Agile, Melee Weapon that rolls a [d6] for medium, [d4] for small, or [d8] for large effect die and threatens to your reach.
            - When you imbue yourself with arcane energy, how do you do it? What does it look like when the energy manifests?
    - **Expertise.**
        - Choose one of your Action Ratings. When you Act Together, leading with that Action, you can suffer only 1 Stress at most, regardless of the number of failed rolls.
            - This special ability is good for covering for your team. If they're all terrible at your favored Action, you don't have to worry about suffering a lot of stress when you lead their group action.*
    - **Like Looking Into The Mirror.**
        - You can always tell when someone is lying to you.
            - This ability works in all situations without restriction. It is very powerful, but also a bit of a curse. You see though every lie, even the kind ones.
    - **Reflexes.**
        - When there's a question about who acts first, the answer is you.
            - You may choose to act Cautiously in combat, but if an enemy would attempt to act against you, you may take your turn before they do.
            - This ability gives you the initiative in most situations. Some specially trained NPCs might also have Reflexes, but otherwise, you're always the first to act, and can interrupt anyone else who tries to beat you to the punch. This ability usually doesn't negate the need to make an action roll that you would otherwise have to make, but it may improve your position or effect.
    - **Shadow.**
        - You may expend 1 Stress to resist a consequence from detection or security measures. Gain Edge on feats of athletics or stealth.
            - When you use this ability, tick 1 Stress on your character sheet. If you "resist a consequence" of the appropriate type, you avoid it completely.*
    - **Sharpshooter.**
        - You do not suffer Snag when making ranged weapon attacks at distances beyond their first range increment. You can **Push Yourself** to do one of the following: *make a ranged attack at extreme distance beyond what's normal for the weapon---unleash a barrage of rapid fire to suppress the enemy.*
            - When you push yourself to activate this ability, you still get one of the normal benefits of pushing yourself (Edge, +1 effect, etc.) in addition to the special ability.
            - The first use of this ability allows you to attempt long-range sniper shots that would otherwise be impossible with typical rudimentary firearms. The second use allows you to keep up a steady rate of fire in a battle (enough to "suppress" a small gang up to six people), rather than stopping for a slow reload or discarding a gun after each shot. When an enemy is suppressed, they're reluctant to maneuver or attack (usually calling for a fortune roll to see if they can manage it).
    - **Vital Strike.**
        - When you **Flank** the single target of an attack you make, when you are **Hidden** from it, or when it is **Incapacitated**; increase the effect damage die of that attack by d4.
- Select one of the below starting items:
    - `[ ]` Well-made thievery gear.
    - `[ ]` Well-made leather armor (2 Load, Light, 2 Soak Boxes, -10 damage/box).
    - `[ ]` Well-made 2H ranged weapon.
    - `[ ]` Well-made greatbow (3 Load, Common, 2H, 150' range, [d10] effect die).
    - `[ ]` *Smoke bombs and a vial of poison.*
    - `[ ]-[ ]` Small Pet (from Bestiary on page XX or create following page XX)
