## Combat

A **Skill Encounter** involves the characters using their skills to overcome obstacles and challenges in the world. This can involve things like sneaking past guards into a castle, navigating treacherous mountains and jungles, chasing a criminal through a city, or constructing a fortification. A *skill encounter* involves characters making skill Rolls and moving closer to their goal until either they complete the challenge, their time runs out, or they fail in a way that gives them another path to follow.

## Entering Combat

When it is determined that a **Combat Encounter** needs to begin, the first step is to determine if any creatures are *Surprised*. Surprise is generally determined by the winner of opposed **Survey** vs **Prowl** rolls. In situations where one side of the combat has no awareness of the other, simply assign *Surprised*. If a creature might be aware (or you want to let the dice decide) but isn't actively watching, those creatures suffer -1 Tier on the **Survey** Roll. *Surprised* creatures may not act during the first round of combat. Other creatures act normally, but **Ambushing** characters act first, taking a full turn. If no creatures are *Surprised*, all creatures may act normally the first round of combat.

A **Round of Combat** involves the following stages:

1. Each player decides if their character acts **Rashly** or **Cautiously** and indicates their choice.
2. All **Ambushing** characters act.
3. All player characters acting **Rashly** take their turns in an order decided by the players.
4. All non-player characters act in an order determined by the GM. This is called the **Monster** turn.
5. All player characters acting **Cautiously** take their turns in an order decided by the players.

When a character's turn ends, you may make a Resistance Roll to reduce the severity of a Wound.

Continue taking rounds until the combat has been decided one way or another whether that is death, defeat, surrender, ceasefire, or retreat. If the player decisions to act *Rashly* or *Cautiously* drags on without resolution have a non-player character take its turn.

## Energy Types

There are 10 **Energy Types**: **Chemical**, **Electrical**, **Entropic**, **Glacial**, **Kinetic**, **Plasmic**, **Psychic**, **Radiant**, **Temporal**, and **Thermal**. While *Energy Type* doesn't have any intrinsic rules, other rules interact with the various types.

## Attack Roll

An **Attack Roll** is a specific type of Action Roll. An Attack Roll targets one or more Defenses (**Iron**, **Ward**, and **Grit**) and, if the roll meets or exceeds the defense rating, the attack is a **hit**, otherwise it is a **miss**.

* Determine how you are attacking.
* Determine the range of the attack.
* Select the targets of the attack.
* Make an Attack Roll for each target of the attack.
    * **Tier/d20! + (Action Rating)/ATTRIBUTE!** vs **Iron**, **Ward**, or **Grit**.
    * If you Push Yourself, roll at +1 Tier.
* If a target is hit, roll damage and resolve any other effects of the attack or weapon.
* If a target is missed, resolve any effects that occur on a miss.

* While in melee, when you make a non-melee, non-touch, non-adjacent Attack Roll suffer -1 Tier.
* While in melee, you gain +5 Defense against non-melee attacks targeting you. Area-of-effect attacks ignore this increase to Defense.

## Damage Roll

A **Damage Roll** determines how many hit points a target loses. An attack or attack power specifies what energy types it deals.

* *For weapon attacks, roll a number of Effect Die equal to half your attacking Action Rating (rounded up) and one attacking Attribute Die and sum them.*
    * *(half Action Rating)[EFFECT] + [ATTRIBUTE]*
    * If you Push Yourself, roll +1 Effect Die.
* *For supernatural attacks, roll a number of Effect Die equal to 1 plus your attacking Action Rating and sum them.*
    * *(1 + Action Rating)[EFFECT]*
    * If you Push Yourself, roll +1 Effect Die.
* *Roll +1 Effect Die equal to the critical multiplier of the attack.*
* *The target loses that many hit points.*
* *Reduce damage by 10 for each Soak Box checked.*
* If a target is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, they die or fall unconscious and begin dying.

## Actions in Combat

Each round you may **Act** twice and **React** twice. You Act during your turn, and React during other's turns.

Players must decide if their characters are going to act *Rashly* or *Cautiously* in each round. A character acting *Rashly* may Act one fewer time and React one fewer time per round (by default, letting them Act once and React once when acting *Rashly*). A character acting *Cautiously* maintains their full complement of actions.

An **Act** represents the primary focus of your turn and generally involves inflicting your will onto an enemy, aiding an ally, preparing for a future turn, or moving.

* Pick up an item.
* Draw or Stow one or two Readied items.
* Make a *Resistance Roll* to reduce the severity of a Wound.
* Use an Action Power.
    * Make a basic attack.
    * Advance up to your stride.
    * Others that your character has selected.

You **React** in response to the actions of another---whether this is hitting an enemy running wildly past you or interposing yourself between danger and an ally.

* Respond to Aid an ally.
* Make a *Resistance Roll* to avoid consequences or reduce damage.
* Use a Reaction Power.

## Movement

An **Advance** is a voluntary, normal movement. Each creature has a **Stride** represented as the number of feet they can Advance when Acting in combat. If you Act to Advance, you may move a number of feet up or equal to your Stride. A **Maneuver** is a voluntary, careful movement that allows you to move without risking Reaction Strikes. If you Act to Maneuver, you may move 5'. An Advance or a Maneuver are voluntary movement.

A movement **Toward** a target requires that each square of movement ends closer to the target than it started. A movement **Away From** a target requires that each 1' of movement ends farther away from the target than it started. A **Push** is a forced movement away from the effect's origin. A **Pull** is a forced movement toward the effect's origin. A **Slide** is a forced movement in any direction. Moving through **Difficult Terrain** costs an additional 1' of movement for each 1' moved. This normally prevents a creature from *Maneuvering* into difficult terrain with their Action. A **Teleport** places a creature within the specified distance in a location they can enter. A creature cannot enter **Impassable Terrain**. A creature can enter **Passable Terrain**.

## Conditions

While **Concealed**, gain +5 Defense.

* *A target gains concealment versus attacks when line-of-sight from the attack's origin is partially obscured---for example by fog, a fence, or bushes---but not by something that would stop attacks.*

While **Hidden**, cannot be targeted by attacks.

* *A target gains Hidden versus a creature that cannot see, hear, or otherwise perceive you. When a Hidden creature makes an attack against a target it is Hidden from, gain +1 Tier on the attack Roll, and that target cannot React to this attack.*

While **Sheltered**, gain +5 Defense and Resistance to all damage types.

* *A target gains Sheltered versus attacks when line-of-sight from the attack's origin is partially obscured by something that would stop attacks---for example, a sturdy wall, structure, obstruction, or boulder.*

While **Winded**, current hit points are less than or equal to half maximum hit points.

* *Whether or not a creature is Winded is public information.*

A creature **threatens** a target in melee when the creature is able to act, wielding a melee weapon, and the target is within the range of that weapon. A target **is threatened by** creature when the creature is able to act, wielding a melee weapon, and the target is within the range of that weapon. A creature is **in melee** if it either threatens an enemy or is threatened by an enemy.

* *While in melee, when you make a non-melee, non-touch, non-adjacent Attack Roll suffer -1 Tier.*
* *While in melee, you gain +5 Defense against non-melee attacks targeting it. Area-of-effect attacks ignore this increase to Defense.*

## Wounds

Attacks may inflict **wounds**, **hit point damage**, or both. Each wound has a **Severity** which defines its duration and how much it affects you.
At the end of your turn, you may make a Resistance Roll to reduce by 1 the severity of a single of your wounds. If this reduces the severity to 0 or less, that wound no longer afflicts you.

### Wounds and their Severity

While **bleeding** *(severity 1--5)*, if you are living, you lose HP at the beginning of your turn.

* *EFFECT = d4/d6/d8/d10/d12*

When **pushed** *(severity 1)*, you are involuntarily moved away from an origin.

When **Slammed** *(severity 3)*, you are involuntarily and forcefully moved away from an origin. If you stop moving because you hit something else, suffer \[d10\] *Kinetic* damage for every 10' moved.

* *You restore HP equal to the regenerating Quality Level + your Tier.*

While **Resistant** *(quality level 3)*, you suffer half damage from one chosen Energy Type. You only need to Resist one of the Energy Types in an attack to take half damage.

While **Sheltered** *(quality level 4)*, you gain **+5 Defense** and Resistance to all damage types.

While **strengthened** *(quality level 1--5)*, you roll **+1** (or +2, +3, +4 or +5) **effect** die.

## Defense Ratings

There are three **Defenses** in the game system that determine if attacks hit: **Iron**, **Ward**, and **Grit**. **Iron** represents agility, ability to avoid damage, fortitude, and resistance to disease and poison. **Ward** represents mental guard, composure, and skill in social situations. **Grit** represents willpower, determination, and persistence. Each Defense has a rating that serves as the **target number** (**TN**) (written as **Defense 10**) which determines whether an attack hits or not. Each **Defense rating** equals **7 plus the character's Tier plus the size of the associated attribute die.**

* *Iron = 7 + Tier + highest face of BODY*
* *Ward = 7 + Tier + highest face of MIND*
* *Grit = 7 + Tier + highest face of WILL*

## Armor & Shields

If you have a type of **Armor** or **Shield** that applies to the situation, you can mark a Soak Box to reduce or avoid a consequence, instead of rolling to resist. If the armor or shield is relevant to the situation, you may mark 1 or more Soak Boxes to reduce the damage dealt by 10.

* *Jonadab, while wearing medium armor, would suffer a crushing blow that would deal 30 points of damage and Stun him - effectively taking him out of the fight. Instead, marking two Soak Boxes reduces the damage dealt by 20 (10 per box) to 10 damage and marking a third Soak Box negates the Stun.*

When a Soak Box is marked, it can't be used again until it's restored. All of Soak Boxes are restored when you choose your **Load** for the next score.

## Hit Points

A character has **Hit Points** (**HP**) representing their health, vitality, and will to fight. When an attack hits or at other triggers (e.g. disease, poison, wounds, etc.), a character might suffer **Damage** to their hit points. This reduces their current HP by that amount. When a character is reduced to zero or fewer HP, they fall unconscious, becoming *Incapacitated*. A character becomes *Winded* when their current hit points are half of or less than their maximum hit points.

* *Hit points = Archetype base + 4/5/6 per Tier + highest face of BODY + highest face of MIND + highest face of WILL.*
    * *HP increases by 4 each Tier for Wizards, 5 each Tier for Rogues and Technicians, and 6 each Tier for Warriors.*
    * *Archetype base is 2 for Wizard, 6 for Rogue or Technician, and 11 for Warrior.*

## Death

There are a couple ways for a Character to die:

If a Character's hit points are reduced to 0, you permanently die. Unless you spend a Beacon Point to avoid death (page XX).

When your character dies, you have options:

* You can create a new character to play. Maybe you "promote" one of your chapter's cohorts to a character, or create a brand new character who joins the chapter.

## Recovery

A character can Recover HP equal to one quarter (round up) of their maximum HP. The normal way to achieve this is by taking 1 Stress during Downtime. Other Powers may allow characters to Recover.
