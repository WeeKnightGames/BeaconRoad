## Combat

A **Skill Encounter** involves the characters using their skills to overcome obstacles and challenges in the world. This can involve things like sneaking past guards into a castle, navigating treacherous mountains and jungles, chasing a criminal through a city, or constructing a fortification. A *skill encounter* involves characters making skill Rolls and moving closer to their goal until either they complete the challenge, their time runs out, or they fail in a way that gives them another path to follow.

## Entering Combat

When it is determined that a **Combat Encounter** needs to begin, the first step is to determine if any creatures are *Surprised*. Surprise is generally determined by the winner of opposed **Survey** vs **Prowl** rolls. In situations where one side of the combat has no awareness of the other, simply assign *Surprised*. If a creature might be aware (or you want to let the dice decide) but isn't actively watching, those creatures suffer -1 Tier on the **Survey** Roll. *Surprised* creatures may not act during the first round of combat. Other creatures act normally, but **Ambushing** characters act first, taking a full turn. If no creatures are *Surprised*, all creatures may act normally the first round of combat.

A **Round of Combat** involves the following stages:

1. Each player decides if their character acts **Rashly** or **Cautiously** and indicates their choice.
2. All **Ambushing** characters act.
3. All player characters acting **Rashly** take their turns in an order decided by the players.
4. All non-player characters act in an order determined by the GM. This is called the **Monster** turn.
5. All player characters acting **Cautiously** take their turns in an order decided by the players.

When a character's turn ends, you may make a Resistance Roll to reduce the severity of a Wound.

Continue taking rounds until the combat has been decided one way or another whether that is death, defeat, surrender, ceasefire, or retreat. If the player decisions to act *Rashly* or *Cautiously* drags on without resolution have a non-player character take its turn.

## Actions in Combat

Each round you may **Act** twice and **React** twice. You Act during your turn, and React during other's turns.

Players must decide if their characters are going to act *Rashly* or *Cautiously* in each round. A character acting *Rashly* may Act one fewer time and React one fewer time per round (by default, letting them Act once and React once when acting *Rashly*). A character acting *Cautiously* maintains their full complement of actions.

An **Act** represents the primary focus of your turn and generally involves inflicting your will onto an enemy, aiding an ally, preparing for a future turn, or moving.

* Pick up an item.
* Draw or Stow one or two Readied items.
* Make a *Resistance Roll* to reduce the severity of a Wound.
* Use an Action Power.
    * Make a basic attack.
    * Advance up to your stride.
    * Others that your character has selected.

You **React** in response to the actions of another---whether this is hitting an enemy running wildly past you or interposing yourself between danger and an ally.

* Respond to Aid an ally.
* Make a *Resistance Roll* to avoid consequences or reduce damage.
* Use a Reaction Power.

## Movement

An **Advance** is a voluntary, normal movement. Each creature has a **Stride** represented as the number of feet they can Advance when Acting in combat. If you Act to Advance, you may move a number of feet up or equal to your Stride. A **Maneuver** is a voluntary, careful movement that allows you to move without risking Reaction Strikes. If you Act to Maneuver, you may move 5'. An Advance or a Maneuver are voluntary movement.

A movement **Toward** a target requires that each square of movement ends closer to the target than it started. A movement **Away From** a target requires that each 1' of movement ends farther away from the target than it started. A **Push** is a forced movement away from the effect's origin. A **Pull** is a forced movement toward the effect's origin. A **Slide** is a forced movement in any direction. Moving through **Difficult Terrain** costs an additional 1' of movement for each 1' moved. This normally prevents a creature from *Maneuvering* into difficult terrain with their Action. A **Teleport** places a creature within the specified distance in a location they can enter. A creature cannot enter **Impassable Terrain**. A creature can enter **Passable Terrain**.

## Conditions

While **concealed**, gain +5 defense.

* *A target gains concealment versus attacks when line-of-sight from the attack's origin is partially obscured - for example by fog, a fence, or bushes - but not by something that would stop attacks.*

While **hidden**, cannot be targeted by attacks.

* *A target gains hidden versus a creature that cannot see, hear, or otherwise perceive you. When a hidden creature makes an attack against a target it is hidden from, gain +1 Tier on the attack Roll and that target may not take reactions to this attack.*

While **sheltered**, gain +5 defense and resistance to all damage types.

* *A target gains sheltered versus attacks when line-of-sight from the attack's origin is partially obscured by something that would stop attacks - for example, a sturdy wall, structure, obstruction, or boulder.*

While **winded**, current hit points are less than or equal to half maximum hit points.

* *Whether or not a creature is winded is public information.*

A creature **threatens** a target in melee when the creature is able to act, wielding a melee weapon, and the target is within the range of that weapon. A target **is threatened by** creature when the creature is able to act, wielding a melee weapon, and the target is within the range of that weapon. A creature is **in melee** if it either threatens an enemy or is threatened by an enemy.

* *While in melee, a creature's non-melee, non-touch, non-adjacent Attack Rolls suffer -1 Tier. While in melee, a creature gains +5 defense against non-melee attacks targeting it.*

## Wounds

Attacks may inflict **wounds**, **hit point damage**, or both. Each wound has a **severity** which defines its duration and how much it affects you.
At the end of your turn, you may make a Resistance Roll to reduce by 1 the severity of a single of your wounds. If this reduces the severity to 0 or less, that wound no longer afflicts you.
