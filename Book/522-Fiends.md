## Fiends

Fiends embody a primordial combination of an elemental spirit and a destructive flaw or temptation. Imps are splinters of a fiend - driven by the same desire for chaos and imbued with the same abilities but not as determined or resilient.

* Air Fiend
    * Air fiends cause despair in those who behold them. Their victims feel as though their dreams and hopes tumble out of reach. Air fiends are covered in black feathers with piercing, golden, hawkish eyes.
* Earth Fiend
    * The daunting strength of earth fiends shatters all it encounters and strikes fear in the hearts of those who behold them. Their bodies are built from gray-black slate and deep brown loam. They stalk their prey with golden-brown lion eyes.
* Fire Fiend
    * The ever-shifting flame of the fire fiend feasts on the folly of those it sees. It fans the fires of their madness seeking to consume their sanity and lives. Fire fiends have sleek red-orange skins.
* Forest Fiend
* Iron Fiend
* Magma Fiend
* Sea Fiend
    * The sea fiend embodies the elemental sea and the hiddenness of shame. Looking like a monstrous humanoid with black shark eyes and dark scales ever dripping the sea, it desires to feed on the destruction of humanity by isolating its victims in the shame of their choices. Those near it hear a constant whisper of their failures like waves crashing into them.
