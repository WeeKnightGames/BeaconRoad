## Sin-eaters

* Sin-eaters exist to take the world's evil into themselves and prevent metahumanity from consuming itself. Each sin-eater voluntarily takes a sacred oath that binds them to their cause for their remaining days and banishes them from civilization. You are a necessary evil - hated and used by all.
* **When you play this crew, you earn xp when you protect civilization or absorb evil.**
* *How voluntary were your oaths? Where did your banishment take you - the wilds, the city's underbelly, across the known world? How do you avoid death and imprisonment from those who hate you? What flavors of evil do you devour?*
* How does payoff work for a sin-eater? Some entity hires a sin-eater to remove some evil they know about.
* How do sin-eaters gain rep? Sin-eaters gain rep by quickly, quietly, and carefully dealing with evil. Without exposing anyone else.
* What organizations or businesses would sin-eaters control or have access to? Sin-eaters cannot have *legal* control of any organizations or businesses (because of their oaths), but evil is everywhere so they would have access to any organizations.
