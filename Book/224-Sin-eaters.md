## Sin-eaters

* Sin-eaters exist to take the world's evil into themselves and prevent metahumanity from consuming itself. Each sin-eater voluntarily takes a sacred oath that binds them to their cause for their remaining days and banishes them from civilization. You are a necessary evil - hated and used by all.
* **When you play this crew, you earn xp when you protect civilization or absorb evil.**
* *How voluntary were your oaths? Where did your banishment take you - the wilds, the city's underbelly, across the known world? How do you avoid death and imprisonment from those who hate you? What flavors of evil do you devour?*
* How does payoff work for a sin-eater? Some entity hires a sin-eater to remove some evil they know about.
* How do sin-eaters gain rep? Sin-eaters gain rep by quickly, quietly, and carefully dealing with evil. Without exposing anyone else.
* What organizations or businesses would sin-eaters control or have access to? Sin-eaters cannot have *legal* control of any organizations or businesses (because of their oaths), but evil is everywhere so they would have access to any organizations.
* What separates sin-eaters as a group from others?
    * Sin-eaters take a sacred, binding oath.
    * Sin-eaters are banished from civilization.
    * Sin-eaters are a necessary evil.
    * They are smaller in number because of the weight of what they take on.
* How are sin-eaters similar to other groups?
    * They're a group.
    * They are better, more efficient, safer, etc. when together than when apart.

### Special Abilities

#### Deadly

Each PC may add +1 action rating to **Hunt**, **Prowl**, or **Skirmish** (up to a max rating of 4).

* *Each player may choose the action they prefer (you don't all have to choose the same one). If you take this ability during initial character and crew creation, it supersedes the normal starting limit of 2 for action ratings.*

#### Death Veil

Due to hard-won experience or arcane ritual, you don't take extra **heat** when killing is involved on a score.

#### Fiends

Fear is as good as respect. You may count each **wanted level** as if it were **turf**.

* *The maximum wanted level is 4. Regardless of how much turf you hold (from this ability or otherwise) the minimum rep cost to advance your Tier is always 6.*

#### Forged in the Fire

Each PC has been toughened by cruel experience. You get **+1 IRON**, **WARD**, and **GRIT**.

* *This ability applies to PCs in the crew. It doesn't confer any special toughness to your cohorts.*

#### Just Passing Through

During **downtime**, take **-1** heat. When your heat is 4 or less, you gain **advantage** to deceive people when you pass yourselves off as ordinary citizens.

#### No Traces

When you keep an operation quiet or make it look like an accident, you get half the **rep** value of the target (round up) instead of zero. When you end downtime with zero heat, take **+1** **rep**.

* *No one wants to be associated with a sin-eater. This ability rewards you for honoring that abhorrence.*

#### Patron

When you advance your **Tier**, it costs half the coin it normally would.

* *Who is your patron? Why do they help you?*
