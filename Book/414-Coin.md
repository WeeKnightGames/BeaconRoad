## Coin

Coin is an abstract measure of casqh and liquid assets.

The few bits characters use in their daily lives are not tracked. If a character wants to spend to achieve a small goal (bribe a doorman), use the character's **lifestyle quality** for a fortune roll.

### Monetary values

* 1 coin: A full purse of silver pieces. A week's wages.
* 2 coin: A fine weapon. A weekly income for a small business. A fine piece of art. A set of luxury clothes.
* 4 coin: A satchel full of silver. A month's wages.
* 6 coin: An exquisite jewel. A heavy burden of silver pieces.
* 8 coin: A good monthly take for a small business. A small safe full of coins and valuables. A very rare luxury commodity.
* 10 coin: Liquidating a significant asset---a carriage and goats, a horse, a deed to a small property.

More than 5 coin is an impractical amount to keep lying around. You must spend the excess or put it in your **Stash** (see below). A Chapter can also store 5 coin in their lair, by default. If they upgrade to a **Vault**, they can expand their stores to 10 and then 20 coin. Any coin beyond their limit must be spent as soon as possible (typically before the next score) or distributed among the chapter members.

One unit of coin in silver pieces or other bulk currency takes up one item slot for your **Load** when carried.

### Coin Use

* Spend 1 coin to get an additional **Activity** during **Downtime**.
* Spend 1 coin to increase the result level of a **Downtime Activity** roll.
* Put coin in your character's **Stash** to improve their lifestyle and circumstances when they retire.
* Spend coin when you advance your Chapter's **Tier**.

## Stash & Retirement

When you retire your character, the amount of coin they've managed to stash away determines their fate. Your stash tracker is on your character sheet.

* **Stash 0--10: Poor Soul.** You end up in the gutter, awash in vice and misery.
* **Stash 11--20: Meager.** A tiny hovel that you can call your own.
* **Stash 21--39: Modest.** A simple home or apartment, with some small comforts. You might operate a tavern or small business.
* **Stash 40--49: Fine.** A well-appointed home or apartment, claiming a few luxuries. You might operate a medium business.
* **Stash 50: Wealthy.** A large home or mansion, with any luxuries you desire. You might operate a large business.

In addition, each full row of stash (10 **coins**) indicates the **quality level of the character's lifestyle**, from 0 (street life) to 5 (luxury).

* *Cross wants some alone-time with a prospective new friend, but he can't take them back to the hidden lair where he lives, so what to do? Ryan, Cross's player, says he wants to rent a nice room for the evening, so the GM asks for a fortune roll using Cross's lifestyle rating to see what quality of room Cross can manage.*

### Removing Coin From Your Stash

If you want to pull coin out of your stash, you may do so, at a cost. Your character sells off some of their assets and investments in order to get some quick cash. **For every 2 stash removed, you get 1 coin in cash.**
