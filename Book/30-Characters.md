# Chapter 3: Characters

Every player at the table---except for the GM---plays a single character. Every character is familiar with all of the various feats represented by the **Actions** of the game. They're all able to **Skirmish** in a knife-fight, **Prowl** in the shadows, **Utter** strange energy into existence, **Consort** with contacts for information, and so on.

Of course, you'll also have your specializations and skills, the qualities that make your character uniquely effective. You might want to pour through ancient tomes looking for lost knowledge and channel arcane energy through your body; or maybe you want to concoct potions, elixirs, oils, unguents, and salves for every situation; or maybe you just want to be the deadliest fighter with a blade. In this chapter, you'll learn how to create your own unique character and choose the abilities that suit the style of play you prefer.
