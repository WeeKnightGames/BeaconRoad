# Chapter 6: Introductory Adventures

## Cultic Initiation, a Sin-eater's problem

While this adventure is intended to provide an introduction for the Sin-eaters, as child kidnapping is a fairly clear evil that most Sin-eaters have vowed to address, you can adapt it to serve any of the Factions. For example, for a Guild, perhaps the abducted boy is the son of a Merchant-Prince that will not engage in trade with you until his son is returned. Or the local guard confiscated your Nomads' airship---assuming you were involved in the kidnapping---until the boy returns. Or your Order has promised to protect those living near your keep, and this boy lives less than a stone's throw away.
