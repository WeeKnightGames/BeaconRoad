# Appendix B: Sandbox Tables

Sometimes you might not be sure what the characters run into. Or they go somewhere you haven't prepared. Or you need something to jog your creativity. Decide what you need and roll the appropriate dice. Then for each matching line on the table, incorporate that into what you're creating. If some of the rolls don't fit or don't make sense, tweak or drop those rolls.
