# Introduction

In a world devastated by Vice run amuck, the city-state of Beacon stands atop a mile high mesa as the only remaining light of civilization. From within it spring forth the Orders and the Guilds---defending the city, providing services, and bringing justice---while outside the city the Nomads and Sin-eaters connect the frontier with civilization and protect its settlements from monsters lurking in the dark.

Welcome to Beacon Road, a game about daring men and women coming together as a faction chapter to exert themselves onto the world of Beacon. We find ourselves in the glorious and eponymous city of Beacon and its surroundings, playing to find out if these individuals can thrive amidst the teeming threats that surround them. The world of Beacon is a world of invigorating light and suffocating dark, of good and evil residing in the hearts of all of metahumanity, of the call of Virtue and the allure of Vice ever present within. As we play, you learn the world is darker than you thought, but that you can be a better influence than you imagined.

Each player creates a character and works with the other players to create the faction chapter to which their characters belong. Each player strives to bring their character to life as an interesting, daring character who reaches boldly beyond their current safety and means. The characters are driven by fame, fortune, obligation, exile, power, love, or any of a hundred other motivations that push someone from the safety and comfort of their homes, lives, and jobs into the uncertain wilds and deeps. They may be a scoundrel, a hero, or something in between, but they are all daring beyond the norm. In addition to creating characters, you'll also create your faction chapter by choosing which type of faction you're interested in exploring and creating your chapter. The characters develop their faction chapter by adventuring, contending with threats from their enemies, mastering themselves, and imposing themselves upon or serving the world around them.

The game master (GM) establishes the dynamic world around the characters. The GM plays all the non-player characters (NPC) in the world by giving each one a concrete desire and preferred method of action. The GM helps organize the game so it's pointed toward the interesting elements of play. The GM isn't in charge of the story and doesn't necessarily have to plan events ahead of time. They present interesting opportunities to the players, then follow the chain of action and consequences wherever they lead.

At the end of the day, one question remains...
