# Bloodlines

Your Bloodline represents not your training or skill or profession but your ancestry and your heritage. Your Bloodline represents biological ties to other metahumanity on Esgyrn. This book defines 8 character Bloodlines: Draconic, Dwarf, Elf, Forgeborn, Halfling, Human, Orc, and Troll---of which 1, Forgeborn, is not living, but constructed.

While this book defines aspects of each of these Bloodlines that are true on Esgyrn, it invites the players to answer the question "What is one thing that is true about your Bloodline in this world?", shaping the world and its inhabitants to the game you want to play. If multiple players play the same Bloodlines, be courteous and work together when answering this question---as you are each defining an aspect of their character and yours.

## Halfblood

* Not fully in one world or another, the question, "Who am I", sits deeper in the Halfblood's soul than in others.
* XP Triggers
    * At the end of a session, mark 1 XP if you struggled with issues from your Vice. Mark XP for this if your Vice tempted you to some bad action. Simply Indulging your Vice doesn’t count as struggling with it (unless you overindulge).
    * At the end of a session, mark 1 XP if you struggled with issues from your Virtue. Mark XP for this if your Virtue drove you toward some good action that complicated the situation. Simply Exemplifying your Vice doesn’t count as struggling with it.
* When you select Halfblood as your Bloodline, choose 2 different Bloodlines representing your immediate parentage or remote ancestry. Even though this is called Halfblood, you may select Forgeborn as 1 of your Bloodlines---perhaps you were born a Troll, seriously wounded, and grafted onto an existing Forgeborn husk.
* Senses, Size, Stride:
    * *How do your two bloodlines manifest in your senses, size, and stride?*
* *What weaknesses or vulnerabilities do you have because of your different bloodlines?*
* Virtue and Vice:
    * *Select your Virtue and Vice from your two bloodlines.*
* Special Abilities
    * **Born of Two Worlds.**
        * You may select one special ability from one of your bloodlines.
            * *This special ability may be taken twice - once for each of your bloodlines.*
* What is one thing that is true about Halfbloods in this world?
