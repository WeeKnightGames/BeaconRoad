# Bloodlines

## Halfblood

* *Not fully in one world or another, the question, "Who am I", sits deeper in the halfblood's soul than in others.*
* When you select Halfblood as your Bloodline, choose 2 different Bloodlines representing your immediate parentage or remote ancestry. Even though this is called Halfblood, you may select Forgeborn as 1 of your Bloodlines---perhaps you were born a Troll, seriously wounded, and grafted onto an existing Forgeborn husk.
* Senses, Size, Stride:
    * *How do your two bloodlines manifest in your senses, size, and stride?*
* *What weaknesses or vulnerabilities do you have because of your different bloodlines?*
* Virtue and Vice:
    * *Select your Virtue and Vice from your two bloodlines.*
* Special Abilities
    * **Born of Two Worlds.**
        * You may select one special ability from one of your bloodlines.
            * *This special ability may be taken twice - once for each of your bloodlines.*
* What is one thing that is true about Halfbloods in this world?
