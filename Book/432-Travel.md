## Average Travel Speeds

The below represent average travel speeds for various modes of transportation over long distances. The listed day length represents a normal day of travel in that conveyance. A longer travel day may be possible but may require extra fuel and will take its toll on the people and vehicles involved.

* *GM: Feel free to inflict stress, hit point damage, wounds, or other appropriate consequences on the characters for pushing themselves beyond normal travel speed or duration.*

The distance on the map of Amehratus between Beacon and A is 15 centimeters. The straight-line distance on Amehratus between the two is roughly 1500 km (4,900,000') - or 100 km/cm. Each hex on the map is about half a centimeter representing about 50 km (164,000') across. Roll a [d20] and, for each hex on the overland map passed through, roll an additional die based on its peril. Sum the d20 and the highest other die:

* 0: Entirely Secure - No roll.
* 1: Reasonably Safe - No additional die.
* 2: Wild - [d4]
* 3: Dangerous - [d6]
* 4: Grave - [d8]
* 5: Perilous - [d10]
* 6: The Bowels of Hell - [d12]

Resolve an encounter based on the rolled sum.

* 1--5: No encounter or a pleasant one.
* 6--10: An avoidable encounter with Tier.
* 11--15: Severe weather or other inclement situation.
* 16--20: An unavoidable encounter with Tier.
* 21--25: Calamitous weather or natural disaster.
* 26--30: An avoidable encounter with Tier + 3.
* 31+: An unavoidable encounter with Tier + 3.

Characters may/must take roles when traveling. Their actions may mitigate or worsen the rolled die.

* An expert tracker may lead others **Acting Together** to make a **desperate** **Prowl** roll vs TN 20 (15 + 5) through Perilous territory. On a success, that hex is treated as Grave instead. On a failure, roll an additional Perilous die for that hex.
