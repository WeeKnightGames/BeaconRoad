    - **Analyst.**
        - During downtime, you get **two ticks** to distribute among any long term project clocks that involve investigation or learning a new formula or design plan.
    - **Artificer.**
        - When you **Invent** or **Craft** a creation with *spark-craft* features, get **+1 quality level** to your roll. You begin with one special design already known.
            - Follow the Inventing procedure with the GM to define your first spark-craft design.
    - **Calculating.**
        - Due to your careful planning, during downtime, you may give yourself or another crew member **+1 downtime activity**.
            - If you forget to use this ability during downtime, you can still activate it during the score and flashback to the previous downtime when the extra activity happened.
    - **Deep Artisan.**
        - When you **Invent** or **Craft** a creation with *arcane* features, get **+1 quality level** to your roll. You begin with 1 Common and 1 Uncommon arcane design already known.
            - Follow the Inventing procedure with the GM to define your first arcane design--or select them from Appendix D: Equipment, Arcane Designs on page XX.
    - **Fortitude.**
        - You may take 1 Stress to resist a consequence of fatigue; weakness; *chemical*, *entropic*, or *thermal* effects. Gain +1 Tier when working with technical skill or handling alchemicals.
            - When you use this ability, tick one Stress on your character sheet. If you resist a consequence, you avoid it completely.
    - **Infuse Weapon**
        - Instead of attacking with a Damaging Attack Power, you may Act to infuse a weapon you hold with that Power. The next attack you make with that weapon will discharge that power. Use the Weapon Attack Roll instead of the Power Attack Roll. A weapon can only be infused with a single Power; infusing it with a second causes the first to expire.
    - **Saboteur**
        - When you wreck, destroy, damage, or ruin structures, items, or mechanism, your work is much quieter than it should be, and the damage is very well-hidden from casual inspection.
            - You can drill holes in things, melt stuff with acid, even use a muffled explosive, and it will all be very quiet and extremely hard to notice.
    - **Sawbones.**
        - Gain +1 Tier on Action Rolls to administer treatment, bind wounds, or help someone heal from trauma.
            - Training - or far too much practice - is essential to properly administer treatment.
