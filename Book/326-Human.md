## Human

* You and I. Humans reach maturity in their late teens to early 20s and, on average, live to be 70 years old. Humans are often pride incarnate. They believe they are right and the best. Occasionally, history backs that claim. Pride can enable a human to defend family and honor or to kill another to avoid embarrassment. But when humanity relinquishes pride, it finds itself best able to serve any and all.
* XP Triggers
    * At the end of a session, mark 1 XP if you struggled with issues from your Vice. Mark XP for this if your Vice tempted you to some bad action. Simply Indulging your Vice doesn’t count as struggling with it (unless you overindulge).
    * At the end of a session, mark 1 XP if you struggled with issues from your Virtue. Mark XP for this if your Virtue drove you toward some good action that complicated the situation. Simply Exemplifying your Vice doesn’t count as struggling with it.
* Living:
    * You are ensouled and biologically alive.
* Senses:
    * Normal. You cannot see in the dark and in dim light suffer Disadvantage on Action Rolls requiring sight.
* Size:
    * Medium (5' × 5'), averaging from 5' to 6' tall and 120 to 220 pounds.
* Stride:
    * 25'. During combat, you may Act to move 25' through normal terrain.
* Virtue:
    * **Service.**
        * Beyond what others cannot or will not, you empower those around you.
* Vice:
    * **Pride.**
        * You are better and more important; everything is about you.
* Special Abilities
    - **Expertise.**
        - Choose one of your Action Ratings. When you Act Together, leading with that Action, you can suffer only 1 Stress at most, regardless of the number of failed rolls.
            - This special ability is good for covering for your team. If they're all terrible at your favored Action, you don't have to worry about suffering a lot of stress when you lead their group action.*
    * **Leader.**
        * When you Command an ally in combat, they gain Advantage on 1 Action Roll they make because of your leadership. You may React to protect an ally from consequence.
        * **Protective Leadership.**
            * Cost: React, 2 Stress.
            * Trigger: An Ally would suffer a consequence.
            * Effect: You suffer that consequence instead.
* What is one thing that is true about Humans in this world?
