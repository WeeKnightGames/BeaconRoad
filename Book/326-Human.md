## Human

* You and I. Humans reach maturity in their late teens to early 20s and, on average, live to be 70 years old. Humans are often pride incarnate. They believe they are right and the best. Occasionally, history backs that claim. Pride can enable a human to defend family and honor or to kill another to avoid embarrassment. But when humanity relinquishes pride, it finds itself best able to serve any and all.
