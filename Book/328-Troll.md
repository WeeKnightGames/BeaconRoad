## Troll

- A mountain brought to life. Trolls do not age as others do and so do not die of old age. Instead they change over time as Esgyrn itself does. A Troll might look and act like a moss-covered rock for decades or centuries before slowly eroding into what appears to be a copse of trees atop a hill.

    * At the end of a session, mark 1 XP if you struggled with issues from your Virtue. Mark XP for this if your Virtue drove you toward some good action that complicated the situation. Simply Exemplifying your Vice doesn’t count as struggling with it.
