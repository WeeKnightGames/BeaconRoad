# Character Creation

1. What kind of character do you want to play?

2. Choose a Bloodline.

    A Bloodline represents your ancestry, heritage, and species.

    When you choose a Bloodline, you're choosing a set of Special Abilities (which give your character ways to break the rules in various ways), a set of XP Triggers (which determine how you earn experience for character advancement), and your Virtue and Vice (which allow your character to regain Expended Stress).

    After choosing your Bloodline, make sure to answer the question:

    > What is one thing that is true about your Bloodline in this world?

3. Choose an Archetype.

    An Archetype represents your training, skill, interests, and desired role.

    When you choose an Archetype, you're choosing a set of Special Abilities and a set of XP Triggers. Every Archetype represents a daring character---whether hero or villain. The Warrior has Special Abilities related to combat, but that doesn't mean they're "the fighter" of the game. Any character type can fight well. Think of your archetype as an area of focus and preference, but not a unique skill set.

    You're selecting the set of initial Action Ratings and Special Abilities that your character has access to---but you're not defining their immutable essence or true nature. Your character will grow and change over time; who they become is part of the fun of playing the game.

4. Detail your Virtue.

    Your Virtue is defined by your bloodline. Every character has Virtues they use to center themselves, influence the world positively, and which they Exemplify to deal with Stress. Describe the specifics of your Virtue.

    * **Cheer** Your unassailable mood lifts the spirits of others in the darkest of times.
    * **Harmony** "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven."
    * **Justice** The afflicted, downtrodden, and oppressed look to you to represent them.
    * **Industry** Nothing is impossible with hardwork, elbow grease, and unflagging endurance.
    * **Remembrance** The past led us to today; allow it to coach us into tomorrow.
    * **Resilience** Whether master or slave, you persist toward your goals.
    * **Resonance** Beauty and splendor in the world reverberate within you and grow around you.
    * **Service** Beyond what others cannot or will not, you empower those around.

5. Detail your Vice.

    Your Vice is defined by your Bloodline. Every character is in thrall to some Vice or another, which they Indulge to deal with Stress. Describe the specifics of your Vice.

    * **Avarice** While dragons sleep on mountains, their descendents love gold and jewel.
    * **Gluttony** "Whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame."
    * **Greed** You are drawn to have and to possess the riches of the earth.
    * **Indolence** Your love of comfort grows unbounded---consuming your interests, time, and energy.
    * **Pride** You are better and more important; everything is about you.
    * **Sorrow** The weight of past pain weighs heavily on you; do not pass it on to others.
    * **Toil** You know nothing but constant work, perpetual striving, and consistent servitude.
    * **Wrath** Everything is wrong; and you're going to fix it---or burn it down.

6. Choose 3 Traits.

    Your character's Traits describe unique personality aspects, flaws, perks, strengths, or weaknesses that aren't easily codified in the game mechanics and that separate you from others and provide motivations, beliefs, or drives. Select 3 of the following traits---or choose your own---and write them on your character sheet. The GM is encouraged to award you a Beacon Point when you play these traits - especially to your detriment.

    > Actor, addicted, aloof, alluring, arrogant, audacious, bitter, bold, bloodlust, brash, cautious, charming, clumsy, cold, courageous, crazed, cruel, cunning, deranged, dimwitted, dishonest, distractible, dominating, fair, foolish, gullible, honest, humble, impatient, inspiring, intimidating, just, loud, mysterious, neurotic, patient, quiet, rash, respectable, sagacious, socially inept, stubborn, strange, thoughtful, vengeful, visionary, vivacious, zealous.

7. Choose a Background.

    Your character's Background describes what they did before they joined this chapter. Choose a Background and then write a detail about it that's specific to your character.

    > Academic, Artisan, Commoner, Criminal, Labor, Military, Noble, Outlaw, Religious, Slave, Tribal.

8. Assign 6 Action Dots.

    At the start of the game, assign 3 Action Dots to 1 Attribute, 2 Action Dots to another Attribute, and 1 Action Dot to the last Attribute. No Action may start with more than 1 Dot (unless a Special Ability tells you otherwise).

    If you aren't sure how to assign your 6 Dots, try something like this:

    * Put 1 Dot in an Action you feel reflects your Bloodline.
    * Put 2 Dots in Actions you feel represent your Archetype.
    * Put 1 Dot in an Action you feel reflects your character's Traits.
    * Put 1 Dot in an Action you feel reflects your character's Background.
    * Put 1 Dot anywhere else.

9. Choose 1 Special Ability from your Bloodline and 1 from your Archetype.

    Take a look at the Special Abilities for your Bloodline and your Archetype, and choose one of each. If you can't decide which one to pick, go with the first one on the list---it's placed there as a good default choice.

10. Choose 1 Common Power for each Action Dot.

    Powers (listed in Appendix A: Powers, page XX) represent masterful skill. They are things your character can do---without having to negotiate with the GM. Each Power has various Prerequisites and Requirements. Ensure you meet those before taking them.

    If the powers don't make sense for your character or you have different ideas, work with your GM to create new Powers.

11. Select 1 of your Archetype's starting items.

    Your Archetype provides a set of starting items that are better than the generally available ones. Select 1 of those you own at the start.

12. Calculate derived stats.

    Derive your Hit Points and Defenses (Iron, Ward, and Grit) and write them down. Your starting amounts are listed below:

    * Starting Hit Points (assuming no Action Rating higher than 1 and 6 starting Action Dots)
        * Wizard hit points start at 24.
        * Rogue and technician hit points start at 29.
        * Warrior hit points start at 34.
    * Starting Defenses
        * The d8 Attribute starts at 16.
        * The d6 Attribute starts at 14.
        * The d4 Attribute starts at 12.

    * **Hit Points** = Archetype base + 4/5/6 per Tier + highest face of BODY + highest face of MIND + highest face of WILL.
        * Wizard archetype base is 2.
        * Rogue and technician archetype base is 6.
        * Warrior archetype base is 10.
    * **Iron** = 7 + Tier + highest face of BODY.
    * **Ward** = 7 + Tier + highest face of MIND.
    * **Grit** = 7 + Tier + highest face of WILL.

13. Choose one close friend and one rival.

    Each Archetype lists NPCs that your character might know. Choose one from the list who is a close relationship (a good friend, a lover, a family relation, etc.). Write them down and mark the upward-pointing triangle next to their name. Then choose another NPC on the list who's your rival or enemy. Write them down and mark the downward-pointing triangle next to their name.

14. Record your name, alias, & look.

    Choose a name for your character from the sample list (Appendix B: Sandbox Tables, Names, page XX), or create your own. If your character uses an alias, make a note of it. Record a few evocative words that describe your character's look (samples provided below).

    * Age: Youthful, adolescent, mature, middle-aged, aging, graying, wizened.
    * Build: Lanky, compact, gaunt, corpulent, sturdy, built, frail.

    * Feet: Boots, bare feet, sandals, slippers, shoes, clogs, clawed, hooves, cloven, paws.

15. Review your details

    Take a look at the details on your character sheet. You begin with access to all of the items on your sheet, so don't worry about picking specific things---you'll decide what your character is carrying later on, when you're on the job.

    That's it! Your character is ready for play. When you start the first session, the GM will ask you some questions about who you are, your outlook, or some past events. If you don't know the answers, make some up. Or ask the other players for ideas.
