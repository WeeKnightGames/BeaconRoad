# Actions & Attributes

An adventure involves conflict, and a game uses rules to resolve those conflicts. To resolve an ambiguous situation, one or more players make dice rolls.

## Action Ratings

There are 12 **Actions** in the game that characters use to overcome obstacles.

* Command
* Consort
* Craft
* Finesse
* Hunt
* Prowl
* Skirmish
* Study
* Survey
* Sway
* Traverse
* Utter

Each Action has a Rating (from 0 to 5) that tells you how many dice to roll when you perform that Action. Action Ratings don't just represent knowledge, skill, or training---you're free to describe *how* your character performs that Action based on the type of person they are. Maybe your character is good at **Command** because they have a scary stillness to them, while another character barks orders and intimidates people with their military bearing.

You choose which Action to perform to overcome an obstacle, by describing what your character does. Actions that are poorly suited to the situation may be less effective and may put the character in more danger, but they can still be attempted. Usually, when you perform an Action, you'll make an **Action Roll** to see how it turns out.

## Action Roll

You make an **Action Roll** when your character does something potentially dangerous, troublesome, or challenging. The possible results of the Action Roll depend on your character's **Position**. There are three positions: **Controlled**, **Risky**, and **Desperate**. If you're in a **Controlled** position, the possible consequences are less serious. If you're in a **Desperate** position, the consequences can be severe. If you're somewhere in between, it's **Risky**---usually considered the "default" position for most actions. In combat, a **Controlled** position decreases the target number by 5; while a **Desperate** position increases it by 5.

If there's no danger, trouble, or uncertainty at hand, you don't make an Action Roll---the GM will probably just say yes, and you'll accomplish your goal.

*Beacon Road* uses four-, six-, eight-, ten-, twelve-, and twenty-sided dice.

To make an Action Roll, roll a number of d20s equal to your Tier and a number of Attribute Dice euqal to your Action Rating and **sum the single highest rolled die of each size**. If the highest rolled for a given size is the maximum that die size can roll, that die **Explodes**: roll another die of that same size and add it to the sum. Continue this as long as a die rolls its maximum. Compare the sum with the **Target Number** (**TN**), if the total is equal or larger, the roll is a **Success** (or a **Hit**). If the sum is less than the **TN**, the roll is a **Failure** (or a **Miss**). A roll of 10 or more over the TN is a **Critical** and confers additional benefits. Each increment of 10 over the TN increases the quality of that success. The number of increments of 10 is called the **Critical Multiplier**. If the check is a failure and the highest d20 is a 1, the check is a **Botch**.

* *GMs, when a player Botches, you gain a Botch Point, explained on page XX.*

When a die is written as **d4**, that represents the die itself. When written, in brackets, as **[d4]**, that represents a bounded die roll (a roll that does not explode). When written with a trailing exclamation point, as **d4!**, the represents an exploding die roll. When a rule says to **increase the die size**, roll the next larger die in the list: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. When a rule says to **decrease the die size**, roll the next smaller die size. In general, this will not decrease a size below d4 or above d12, but the GM may rule differently.

An **Action Roll** is written out as **Tier/d20! + Action/ATTRIBUTE! vs TN**---this will often be shortened to **TIER! + ACTION! vs TN** and even **ACTION! vs TN**. This means rolling a number of **d20**s equal to your **Tier** and rolling a number of **Attribute Dice** equal to your **Action Rating**. Certain effects may modify your effective Tier or Action Rating for a roll. If either **Tier** or **Action Rating** are 0 or lower, roll 2 of that dice size and take the lowest. The TN can be a static number, a defense, or an action.

* *Tier depends on your Chapter and is explained on page XX.*
* *A character in a Tier 2 Chapter is making a roll in a precarious situation. Start at Tier 2 and suffer -1 Tier for the precarious situation. Make the final roll at Tier 1 (a single d20).*

## Effect Roll

Under some situations, an Action Roll is insufficient to fully resolve a character's actions. Perhaps we need to determine how much damage an attack does in combat. This kind of roll, called an **Effect Roll** involves rolling several dice at once and **summing all rolled dice**. No dice explode in these rolls. For example, when an attack hits, make a damage roll and reduce their remaining HP by the rolled amount.

## Attribute Ratings

There are three **Attributes** in the game system that the player characters use to act: **Body**, **Mind**, and **Will**.

**Body** measures physical prowess, health, strength, agility, and physical dexterity. **Mind** measures intelligence, learning, memory, speed of thought, perception, and awareness. **Will** measures determination, drive, courage, force of personality, charisma, and presence. An Attribute written in all capitals as **BODY**, **MIND**, or **WILL** refers to the Attribute die. ATTR refers to a single Attribute but may refer to any of them.

* *ATTR represents the die, ATTR! represents an exploding die, [ATTR] represents a bounded, non-exploding die.*

Each Attribute has a rating (from 0 to 5) that determines the **Attribute Dice** you use when making action rolls.

The rating for each Attribute is equal to the number of dots in the **first column** under that Attribute. The more well-rounded your character is with a particular set of actions, the better their Attribute rating. The dice for each Attribute is determined as follows: rating 0 rolls no additional dice, rating 1 rolls four-sided dice (a d4), rating 2 rolls six-sided dice (a d6), rating 3 rolls eight-sided dice (a d8), rating 4 rolls ten-sided dice (a d10), and rating 5 rolls twelve-sided dice (a d12).

**Average Dice Rolls with Explosions**

|     |  0  |  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |
|-----|-----|------|------|------|------|------|
| d4  | 2   | 3.3  | 4.6  | 5.6  | 6.2  | 6.8  |
| d6  | 2.6 | 4.2  | 5.8  | 6.8  | 7.6  | 8.3  |
| d8  | 3.2 | 5.1  | 7.1  | 8.3  | 9.1  | 9.9  |
| d10 | 3.9 | 6.1  | 8.2  | 9.7  | 10.7 | 11.5 |
| d12 | 4.6 | 7.1  | 9.6  | 11.2 | 12.3 | 13.1 |
| d20 | 7.2 | 11.1 | 14.9 | 17.1 | 18.6 | 19.7 |

* *You might sneak past a guard or hide in the shadows. You might run and leap across the rooftops. You might attack someone from hiding with a back-stab or blackjack. You could try to waylay a victim in the midst of battle (but Skirmishing might be better).*

When you **Skirmish**, you entangle a target in close combat so they can't easily escape.

* *You might brawl or wrestle with them. You might hack and slash. You might seize or hold a position in battle. You could try to fight in a formal duel (but Finessing might be better).*

When you **Study**, you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.

When you **Survey**, you observe the situation and anticipate outcomes.

When you **Sway**, you influence with guile, charm, or argument.

As you can see, many actions overlap with others. This is by design. As a player, you get to choose which action you roll, by saying what your character does. Can you try to **Sway** someone during a fight? Sure! As it says, **Command** *might* be better (less risky or more effective), depending on the situation at hand (sometimes it won't be better).
