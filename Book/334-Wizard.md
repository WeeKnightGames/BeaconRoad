        - You have made a pact with some powerful entity to channel its power - in exchange.
            - *You suffer other consequences instead of taking stress to use rituals or cast spells. Is this health, coin, luck, relationships, mishaps?*
            - *Work with the GM to define your pact and your first spell. If you aren't certain, choose Bloodpact.*
        - **Bloodpact.** *Instead of taking Stress when you use a Power, lose \[d4\] HP per Stress in the power's cost. Gain Draw Blood.*

            - Requires: A dagger (or other blade).
            - Cost: Act.
            - Target: Self.
            - Effect: Select an ACTION. Lose up to 1 + ACTION HP. The next time you Act or React, if you use a Power with that ACTION, reduce the Stress cost by the number of HP lost (not below 1).

    - **Meditation.**
        - Take **1 stress** to roll **Utter** while performing a different action. Say how you channel your magic to this use.
            - *This is the "jack-of-all-trades" ability. If you want to attempt lots of different sorts of actions and still have a good dice pool to roll, this is the special ability for you.*
    - **Ritual.**
        - You know the arcane methods to perform ritual sorcery. You can **Study** an arcane ritual (or create a new one) to summon a supernatural effect or being. You begin with one ritual already learned.
            - *Without this special ability, the study and practice of rituals leaves you utterly vulnerable to the powers you supplicate. Such endeavors are not recommended.*
            - *Follow the Ritual creation procedure with the GM to define your first ritual.*
    - **Spellcraft.**
        - You know the arcane methods to conjure supernatural effects from written spells. You can **Study** a spell (or create a new one) to summon a supernatural effect. You begin with one spell already learned.
            - *Without this special ability, written spells are only words on a page.*
            - *Follow the Spell Creation procedure with the GM to define your first spell.*
        - **Studied Spells.** *Studied Spells allows you to reduce Stress costs of Powers using UTTER. Select appropriate Powers. Reduce their Stress costs (not below 1). You cannot reduce Stress costs more than a cumulative 1 + TIER + UTTER.*
            - *For example, if you are Tier 2 with Utter 4 (so 1 + 2 + 4 = 7), you could reduce the Stress cost of one Power by 3 and another by 4.*
