    - **Arcane Mind.**
        - You're always aware of supernatural entities in your presence. Gain +1 Tier when you **Gather Information** about the supernatural by any means.
    - **Bargain.**
        - You have made a pact with some powerful entity to channel its power - in exchange.
            - *You suffer other consequences instead of taking stress to use rituals or cast spells. Is this health, coin, luck, relationships, mishaps?*
            - *Work with the GM to define your pact and your first spell. If you aren't certain, choose Bloodpact.*
        - **Bloodpact.** *Instead of taking Stress when you use a Power, lose \[d4\] HP per Stress in the power's cost. Gain Draw Blood.*
    - **Draw Blood**
        - Prerequisites: Bargain.
        - Requires: A dagger (or other blade).
        - Cost: Act.
        - Target: Self.
        - Effect: Select an Action. Lose up to 1 + Action HP. The next time you Act or React, if you use a Power with that Action, reduce the Stress cost by the number of HP lost (not below 1).
    - **Inhuman Resolve.**
        - You are immune to the terror that some supernatural entities inflict. You gain +2 **Grit**.
            - *With this ability, you do not freeze up or flee when confronted by any kind of supernatural entity or strange arcane event.*
    - **Meditation.**
        - Take **1 Stress** to roll **Utter** while performing a different action. Say how you channel your magic to this use.
            - *This is the "jack-of-all-trades" ability. If you want to attempt lots of different sorts of actions and still have a good dice pool to roll, this is the special ability for you.*
    - **Read and Recite**
        - Prerequisites: Spellcraft.
        - Requires: Your spellbook or tome.
        - Cost: Act.

        - Effect: Select a Power. If you use that Power the next time you Act or React, reduce the Stress cost by the invoking ACTION (not below 1).
    - **Ritual.**
        - You know the arcane methods to perform ritual sorcery. You can **Study** an arcane ritual (or create a new one) to summon a supernatural effect or being. You begin with one ritual already learned.
            - Without this special ability, the study and practice of rituals leaves you utterly vulnerable to the powers you supplicate. Such endeavors are not recommended.
            - Follow the Ritual creation procedure with the GM to define your first ritual.
    - **Spellcraft.**
        - You know the arcane methods to conjure supernatural effects from written spells. You can **Study** a spell (or create a new one) to summon a supernatural effect. You begin with one spell already learned.

            - *Follow the Spell Creation procedure with the GM to define your first spell.*
    - **Studied Spells.**
        - Studied Spells allows you to reduce Stress costs of Powers using Utter. Select appropriate Powers. Reduce their Stress costs (not below 1). You cannot reduce Stress costs more than a cumulative 1 + Tier + Utter.
            - For example, if you are Tier 2 with Utter 4 (so 1 + 2 + 4 = 7), you could reduce the Stress cost of one Power by 3 and another by 4.
    - **Warded.**
        - You may take 1 Stress to resist a supernatural consequence. Gain +1 Ward.
- Select one of the below starting items:
