## Order

* An order of "knights" that do knightly things
* Instead of Hunting Grounds or Flavors of Evil, how about Vows or Oaths or Principles?
    * Oath of Generosity?
    * Or should this be more like Oath of the Destruction of Unjust Social Structures?
    * Censures?
* Oath and Censure?

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
