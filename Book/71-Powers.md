# Appendix A: Powers

Powers represent masterful skill that enables you to inflict additional wounds or magic than is normal. For every Action Rating above zero, work with the GM to gain a Power (usable in encounters) for that Action. Your Powers must meet any listed requirements. When you increase your Action Ratings after the game has begun, you will need to spend Downtime Actions to learn new Powers. The Powers below are written for specific Action Ratings and Attributes. If some of these don't make sense for your campaign or character, work with the GM to modify their Attributes, Action Ratings, Prerequisites, or Requirements; change the narrative description of a Power that matches what you want to do, mechanically, but tells the wrong story; or create new Powers that fit the world.
