## Dwarf

* Built from stone. Dwarves reach maturity in their mid 20s but are considered young until their 60s and, on average, live to be 300 years old. Dwarves are, in some ways, defined by their greed. It can be a force for great good in dwarven communities when it promotes industry, wealth, prosperity, exploration, and kinship; but it brings great destructive power when it leads to jealous murder, hoarding, and the gold-madness.
* XP Triggers
    * At the end of a session, mark 1 XP if you struggled with issues from your Vice. Mark XP for this if your Vice tempted you to some bad action. Simply Indulging your Vice doesn’t count as struggling with it (unless you overindulge).
    * At the end of a session, mark 1 XP if you struggled with issues from your Virtue. Mark XP for this if your Virtue drove you toward some good action that complicated the situation. Simply Exemplifying your Vice doesn’t count as struggling with it.
* Living:
    * You are ensouled and biologically alive.
* Senses:
    * Dimsight. You can see normally in dim light and when in the dark suffer Disadvantage on Action Rolls requiring sight.
* Size:
    * Medium (5' × 5'), averaging from 4' to 5' tall and 150 to 225 pounds.
* Stride:
    * 20'. During combat, you may Act to move 20' through normal terrain.
* Virtue:
    * **Industry.**
        * Nothing is impossible with hardwork, elbow grease, and unflagging endurance.
* Vice:
    * **Greed.**
        * You are drawn to have and to possess the riches of the earth.
* Special Abilities
    * **Lettered in Stone.**
        * You know the dwarven secrets of lettering metal, stone, wood, leather, and cloth to imbue it earthen power. You can **Study** the runic lettering (or create a new one) to strengthen or alter an item or allow it to produce a supernatural effect. You begin with one runic lettering already learned.
            * Follow the Runic Lettering Creation procedure with the GM to define your runic lettering.
    * **Strapping.** Your load limits are higher, and you are not slowed by your load. Light: 5. Normal: 7. Heavy: 8.
        * Dwarves make Mules look like weaklings.
        * This ability is great if you want to wear heavy armor and pack a heavy weapon without attracting lots of attention. Since your exact gear is determined on-the-fly during an operation, having more load also gives you more options to get creative with when dealing with problems during a score.
* What is one thing that is true about Dwarves in this world?
