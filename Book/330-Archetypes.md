# Archetypes

Your Archetype provides the baseline for how your character expresses itself into the world. Anyone might sneak into a locked building, but while Rogue would likely pick the lock, a Warrior would smash the door, or a Technician create a device that unlocks the door, or a Wizard cloud the minds of those around them so they can walk in unopposed.
