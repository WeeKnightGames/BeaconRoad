# Archetypes

Your Archetype provides the baseline for how your character expresses itself into the world. Anyone might sneak into a locked building, but while Rogue would likely pick the lock, a Warrior would smash the door, or a Technician create a device that unlocks the door, or a Wizard cloud the minds of those around them so they can walk in unopposed.

## Special Abilities

Each character has access to Bloodline-specific and Archetype-specific Special Abilities. All characters have access to the following Special Abilities:

- **Exemplar.**
    - Increase one of your Attribute Ratings by 1.
- **Seasoned.**
    - You may take a Special Ability from a different Archetype.
    - This Special Ability may be taken 3 times.
