# Adventure

We play to find out if the Chapter and its Characters can make their way in the world---and their ability to establish and exert themselves depends upon their endeavors, which we call **Adventures**.

An Adventure is a single operation with a particular goal: *rescue a kidnapped child, establish trade routes throughout the city, stop encroaching monsters, locate an ancient artifact*, etc. Usually, an Adventure will fall into one of three categories:

* A **chapter-focused activity**, determined by your Crew type---stopping evil, defending the oppressed, establishing order, escorting people.
* Seizing a **claim** that you choose from your Chapter's **claim map**.
* A **special mission** or goal determined by the players (like getting a rare artifact to empower a ritual).

An Adventure can be long and involved or short and sweet. There might be lots of rolls and trouble, or just a few actions to resolve it. *Play to find out what happens!* An Adventure doesn't need to fill one session of play every time. Let it be however long it is.

The Characters can set up a new Adventure by choosing a target (from their claims or the faction list, for example), by approaching a potential client and asking for work, or by being contacted by an NPC who needs to hire a crew for a job.

An Adventure consists of a few key elements, detailed below: **Gathering Information**, **Planning & Engagement**, **Flashbacks**, **Teamwork**, **Combat**, etc...

## Giving up on a Adventure

When you give up on a Adventure, you go into **Downtime**. Follow the phases for downtime presented in the next chapter. You'll usually have zero **Payoff**, since you didn't accomplish anything.
