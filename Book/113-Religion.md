* Monotheism
    * The Cult of the Murdered Exile
        * Long ago the Murdered Exile (before he was known by that name) built the multiverse we live in by his breath, by his bones, and by his blood. This is why we call our planet Esgyrn. He then created metahumanity and invested in them the call to tend the cosmos and to create and to rule, not in dominance but in humility. In metahumanity resided the creative power to do this, but instead they fell to worshipping their creations, feelings, and urges. As they did, they relinquished their innate power. This power coalesced into beings of great power who fed on humanity while appearing to serve them. We call these being gods or demons depending on whether we publicly believe them to be good. But the lie is that all of them come from the same place, the abdicated authority and power of humanity. As they abandoned their deep vocation, they fell into wickedness. Their sight became blinded to reality. The immediate, the selfish, the subjugation of others took priority over tending to reality. The gods grew in power. With every passing generation of humanity, their innate power waned as they surrendered it to the gods.
        * Finally the Murdered Exile decided to intervene, to help humanity to recapture their calling, their morality, their sanity, and their power. He came to Esgyrn as a child and taught, but he was a threat to the order of the gods and humanity feared the change, having so given into their worship of the gods. So humanity, at their own foolishness and the manipulation of the gods, murdered him on the outskirts of Beacon. A few of his followers claim he did not remain dead, but even fewer take that claim seriously - neither gods nor people rise from the dead. Some think he began the work of freeing humanity from their created gods.
        * Followers of the gods claim the Murdered Exile was a god (or a man) like any other who misused the power he had. They also do not believe the gods are created, but have their own creation stories of how the gods created Esgyrn.
        * Followers of the Murdered Exile claim the Pantheon does not possess innate power but is granted power by those who worship them.
        * Sin-eaters often claim the Murdered Exile was the first sin-eater.
* Polytheism
    * The Pantheon
        * In the beginning, Chaos reigned alone making and unmaking. Worlds and universes and beings popped into existence and were destroyed moments later. This continued for countless, timeless eons until something was created that was able to prevent itself from being destroyed. It wandered reality seeking kin until it found something else that remained. Together they became something more, they became Lady Love and the Storm Captain. With their children, they fought the tyranny of Chaos until it became obvious that something must be done. Lady Love gave birth to Esgyrn - a world that stood in opposition to Chaos. The Pantheon fought and bound Chaos in the sun, in the stars, and in the seas. The Pantheon multiplied and created metahumanity to work the earth.
        * Gods and Goddesses
            * Lady Love - goddess of sex and fertility
            * Storm Captain - god of seas and storms
            * Brothers Wilde - Stag and Stone - brother gods of nature, wilderness, the hunt, ecosystems

            * First Mage - goddess of the arcane, creation, and technology
            * Champion of Light - god of righteousness, justice, defending the poor, fighting against evil
            * The Shadow King - god of death, dreams, and sorrow
            * Hearth-keeper - god of food, drink, home, and hearth
            * The Whisperer - goddess of truth, knowledge, and secrets

            * Fury-heart - god of emotion, sensation, experience
* Pantheism
* Atheism
    * In the beginning there was nothing. Then it exploded into reality. The cosmos was formed and coalesced into the stars. As stars exploded and reality cooled, planets formed from the detritus of stars. Over billions of years, life formed and evolved into metahumanity as we have it today.
        * A god that can be killed is either an impostor or not a god worth serving so the Murdered Exile is a joke. No one rises from the dead so the crux of the story of the Murdered Exile is fabrication.
        * Gods that gain their power from those who serve them are not gods but usurpers.
