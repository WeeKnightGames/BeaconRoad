## Planning & Engagement

Your Chapter spends time planning each Adventure. They might huddle around a flickering lantern in the dark, looking at scrawled maps, whispering plots and schemes; or they might discuss grand strategy in a hall, arguing about the best approach, lamenting the dangers ahead; or perhaps they are riding across the plains, detailing their plan of approach, hoping for victory in the face of overwhelming odds.

But you, the players, don't have to do the nitty-gritty planning. The characters take care of that, off-screen. All you have to do is choose what **type of plan** the characters *have already made*. There's no need to sweat all the little details and try to cover every eventuality ahead of time, because the **engagement roll** (detailed below) ultimately determines how much trouble you're in when the plan is put in motion. *No plan is ever perfect.* You can't account for everything. This system assumes that there's always some unknown factors and trouble---major or minor---in every operation; you just have to make the best of it.

There are six different plans, each with a missing **detail** you need to provide (see the list below). To "plan an operation," simply choose the plan and supply the detail. Then the GM will **cut to the action** as the first moments of the operation unfold.

* **Arcane**---Engage a supernatural power. *Detail: The arcane method.*
* **Assault**---Do violence to a target. *Detail: The point of attack*.
* **Deception**---Lure, trick, or manipulate. *Detail: The method of deception.*
* **Stealth**---Trespass unseen. *Detail: The point of infiltration.*
* **Social**---Negotiate, bargain, or persuade. *Detail: The social.*
* **Transport**---Carry cargo or people through danger. *Detail: The route.*

### The Detail

When you choose a plan, you provide a missing **detail**, like the point of attack, social connection, etc. If you don't know the detail, you can **Gather Information** in some way to discover it.

### Item Loadouts

After the plan and detail are in place, each player chooses their character's **Load**. This indicates how much stuff they're carrying on the operation. They don't have to select individual items---just the maximum amount they'll have access to during the action.

### Engagement Roll

Once the players choose a plan and provide its detail, the GM cuts to the action---describing the scene as the Chapter starts the operation and encounters their first obstacle. But how is this established? The way the GM describes the starting situation can have a huge impact on how simple or troublesome the operation turns out to be. Rather than expecting the GM to simply "get it right" each time, we use a dice roll instead. This is the **Engagement Roll**.

The engagement roll is an Action Roll based on whoever is leading the introduction into the Adventure. Modify the roll for any major advantages or disadvantages that apply.

### Major Advantages / Disadvantages

* Is this operation particularly bold or daring? Gain Advantage. Is this operation overly complex or contingent on many factors? Roll Disadvantage.
* Does the **plan's detail** expose a vulnerability of the target or hit them where they're weakest? Gain Advantage. Is the target strongest against this approach, or do they have particular defenses or special preparations? Roll Disadvantage.
* Can any of your **friends or contacts** provide aid or insight for this operation? Gain Advantage. Are any **enemies or rivals** interfering in the operation? Roll Disadvantage.
* Are there any **other elements** that you want to consider? Maybe a lower-Tier target will give you Advantage. Maybe a higher-Tier target will give you Disadvantage. Maybe there's a situation that makes the operation more or less tricky.

The engagement roll assumes that the Characters are approaching the target as intelligently as they can, given the plan and detail they provided, so we don't need to play out tentative probing maneuvers, special precautions, or other ponderous non-action. The engagement roll covers all of that. The Characters are already in action, facing the first obstacle-up on the rooftop, picking the lock on the window; kicking down the door of the rival gang's lair; maneuvering to speak with a Lord at the masquerade party; etc.

Don't make the engagement roll and then describe the Characters *approaching* the target. It's the approach that the engagement roll resolves. Cut to the action that results *because of* that initial approach-to the first serious obstacle in their path.

### Engagement Roll

* Action Roll versus **controlled**, **risky**, or **desperate** target number.
* **Advantage** for each **Major** **Advantage.**
* **Disadvantage** for each **Major** **Disadvantage.**
* **Critical:** Exceptional result. *You've already overcome the first obstacle and you're in a controlled position for what's next.*
* **Success:** Good result. *You're in a controlled position when the action starts.*
* **Failure:** Mixed result. *You're in a risky position when the action starts.*
* **Botch:** Bad result. *You're in a desperate position when the action starts.*
* *The first obstacles at the witches' house are their cunning locks and magical traps. The engagement roll puts us on the roof outside a window, as the Characters attempt to silently and carefully break into the attic.*
* *The Characters have kicked down the door and swarmed into the front room of the gang's lair, weapons flashing, into the swirl of the melee with the first guards.*
* *The Characters have socialized politely at the party, maneuvering into position to have a private word with a powerful Lord. As a group of young nobles leave his side, the Characters step up and engage him in conversation.*

If the players want to include a special preparation or clever setup, they can do so with **Flashbacks** during the Adventure. This takes some getting used to. Players may balk at first, worried that you're skipping over important things that they want to do. But jumping straight into the action of the Adventure is much more effective once you get used to it. When they see the situation they're in, their "planning" in flashbacks will be focused and useful, rather than merely speculations on circumstances and events that might not even happen.

### Outcomes

The outcome of the engagement roll determines the **position** for the Characters' initial actions when we cut to the Adventure in progress. A **botch** means a desperate position. A **failure** is a risky position. A **success** yields a controlled position. And a **critical** carries the action beyond the initial obstacle, deeper into the action of the Adventure.

No matter how low-Tier or outmatched you are, a desperate position is the worst thing that can result from the plan + detail + engagement process. It's designed this way so the planning process matters, but it doesn't call for lots of optimization or nitpicking. Even if you're reckless and just dive in and take your chances, you can't get too badly burned. Plus, you might even want that desperate position to require your characters to Push Themselves and fail generating more XP for the Characters, which helps to bootstrap starting characters into advancement.

When you describe the situation after the roll, use the details of the target to paint a picture of the Characters' position. How might the strange, occult gang present a desperate position for burglars? How might the violent and ruthless butchers present a risky threat to assaulting thugs? How might the vain and pompous Lord present a controlled opportunity for a manipulative scoundrel? Use this opportunity to show how the Characters' enemies are dangerous and capable---don't characterize a bad engagement roll as a failure by the Characters, or they won't trust the technique in the future. Sure, things are starting out desperate here against the creepy occultists, but you're just the type of characters who are daring enough to take them on. Let's get to it.

### How long does it last?

The engagement roll determines the starting position for the Characters' actions. How long does that hold? Does the situation stay desperate? No. Once the initial actions have been resolved, you follow the normal process for establishing position for the rest of the rolls during the Adventure. The engagement roll is a quick short-hand to kick things off and get the action started---it doesn't have any impact after that.

### Linked Plans

Sometimes an operation seems to call for a couple of plans linked together. A common scenario is a team that wants a two-pronged approach. "You create a diversion at the tavern, and when they send thugs over there, we'll break into their lair." There are two ways to handle this.

1. The diversion is a **setup maneuver** that a team member performs as part of the plan. A successful setup maneuver can improve **position** for teammates (possibly offsetting a bad engagement roll) or give increased effect. An unsuccessful setup maneuver might cause trouble for the second part of the plan---an easy consequence is to give the engagement roll Disadvantage. *If it makes sense, the team member who performed the setup can drift back into the main operation and join the team later so they don't have to sit out and wait.*
2. The diversion is its own plan, engagement, and operation, whose outcome creates the opportunity for a future plan. Use this option when the first part of the plan is required for the next part to happen at all. For example, you might execute a stealth plan to steal an artifact from the Museum of the Ancients, then later use that artifact in an occult plan to consecrate a temple for your forgotten god. In this case, you go into downtime (and payoff, heat, etc.) after the first part of the plan, as normal.

Either approach is fine. It's usually a question of interest. Is the linked plan idea interesting enough on its own to play out moment by moment? Is it required for the second plan to make sense? If so, make it a separate operation. If not, just use a setup maneuver.
