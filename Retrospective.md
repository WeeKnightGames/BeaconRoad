# Beacon Road Retrospective

After taking a few months off from Beacon Road development and playing other games (Pathfinder Playtest, 13th Age, 7 Wonders, Arcadia Quest, Kingdom Builder, Scythe, etc.), here are my thoughts on what the game had become, where it went wrong, and where it went right.

## The Good

- Emphasized player agency.
- Overall dice system.
    - Exploding dice.
    - Dice as attributes (size) and skills (number).
- Stress
    - Player choice.
    - Push Yourself for Advantage, +1 effect die.
    - Used to cast spells, do powers, etc.
    - Martial characters spent less on their powers giving them more to Push; while Spellcasters spent more on their more powerful powers.
- Load
    - Boxes
    - Determine amount at beginning of mission
    - Determine specifics later
- Soak Boxes
    - Simple, player-controlled damage mitigation.
- Advancement
    - Push Yourself and Fail is mark XP.

## The Bad

- The last rewrite dropped the bloodline, archetype, and level system that I'd wanted in favor of something more like a point buy.
    - Want class + level.
    - Or "tech tree" + level.
    - Want something to focus character while providing mechanism for "multiclassing".
- Complexity and fiddliness rather than simplicity with depth.
    - Though significantly mitigated after talking with Russ.
- It's far from done. And a ton of work.

## The Ugly

- Faction rules (sin-eaters, order, guilds, and nomads) never coalesced.
- Vice and virtue didn't get tied to Stress as meaningfully as I'd like.
- Limited attribute advancement (due to dice sizes).
- No great ways to have accurate or inaccurate weapons.
- Asymptotic progression.
    - Increasing the skill rating (and thus number of attribute dice rolled) is more effective for an unskilled person than for a skilled one.
    - Hard to represent advantages that a skilled individual can exploit, that an unskilled individual cannot.
- Advancement
    - XP Triggers (voluntarily fail Y and gain XP never materialized).
    - Characters can advance at fairly different rates.
- Combat turns.
    - Acting Rashly (go before, 1 Action, 1 Reaction), Monster, Action Cautiously (go after, 2 Actions, 2 Reactions).
    - Enjoyed by players, disliked by me as GM.
- I don't know if I care enough/have enough stamina to finish the game.
- Coin
    - I never felt comfortable with how to handle small expenses when 1 Coin represents a substantial amount of money.
- Liked original bloodline advancements.
    - You become more "elven" when you take a level in Elf.
    - Changed to unlocked Special Abilities.
