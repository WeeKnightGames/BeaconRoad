## Action Roll Summary

* A player or GM calls for a roll. Make an **action roll** when the character performs a dangerous or troublesome action.
* The player chooses the **action rating** and associated **ATTRIBUTE** to roll. Choose the action that matches what the character is doing in the fiction.
* The GM establishes the **position** and **effect level** of the action. The choice of position and effect is influenced strongly by the player's choice of action.
* Gain up to Advantage 2. 1) **Assistance** from a teammate. 2) **Push yourself** (take 1 stress).
* Roll the dice and judge the outcome. The players and GM narrate the action together. The GM has final say over what happens and inflicts consequences as called for by the position and the result of the roll.

### Action Roll

* Roll d20! and **ATTRIBUTE!** dice equal to your **Action Rating**.
* Gain **Advantage** equal to your **Tier**.
* Gain **Advantage** if you have **Assistance**.
* Gain **Advantage** if you **Push Yourself**.
* **Controlled** (base TN = 6 + target's Tier)-You act on your terms. You exploit a dominant advantage.
    * **Critical:** You do it with **increased effect** proportional to the critical multiplier.
    * **Success:** You hesitate. Withdraw and try a different approach, or else do it with a minor consequence: a minor **complication** occurs, you have **reduced effect**, you suffer **lesser harm**, you end up in a **risky** position.
    * **Failure:** You falter. Press on by seizing a **risky** opportunity, or withdraw and try a different approach.
* **Risky** (base TN = 11 + target's Tier)-You go head to head. You act under fire. You take a chance.
    * **Critical:** You do it with **increased effect** proportional to the critical multiplier.
    * **Success:** You do it, but there's a consequence: you suffer **harm**, a **complication** occurs, you have **reduced effect**, you end up in a **desperate** position.
    * **Failure:** Things go badly. You suffer **harm**, a **complication** occurs, you end up in a **desperate** position, you **lose this opportunity**.
* **Desperate** (base TN = 16 + target's Tier)-You overreach your capabilities. You're in serious trouble.
* **Critical:** You do it with **increased effect** proportional to the critical multiplier.
* **Success:** You do it, but there's a consequence: you suffer **severe harm**, a **serious complication** occurs, you have **reduced effect**.
* **Failure:** It's the worst outcome. You suffer **severe harm**, a **serious complication** occurs, you **lose this opportunity** for action.

## Attack Roll

An **attack roll** is a specific type of action roll. An attack roll targets one or more defenses (**IRON**, **WARD**, and **GRIT**) and, if the roll meets or exceeds the defense rating, the attack is a **hit**, otherwise it is a **miss**.

* Determine how you are attacking.
* Determine the range of the attack.
* Select the targets of the attack.
* Make an attack roll for each target of the attack.
    * **TIER! + (Action Rating)/ATTRIBUTE!** vs **IRON**, **WARD**, or **GRIT**.
* If a target is hit, roll damage and resolve any other effects of the attack or weapon.
    * *Roll a number of Effect Die equal to half your attacking Action Rating (rounded up) and one attacking Attribute Die and sum them.*
        * *(half Action Rating)[EFFECT] + [ATTRIBUTE]*
    * *Roll additional Effect Die equal to the critical multiplier of the attack.*
    * *The target loses that many hit points.*
    * *Or zero if the target uses Armor or some other ability that would allow them to negate damage.*
* If a target is missed, resolve any effects that occur on a miss.
* If a target is reduced to zero or fewer hit points, they die or fall unconscious and begin dying.
    * If a character is at negative half your maximum hit points, you permanently die.

## Pushing Yourself

You can use stress to **push yourself** for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, take **1 stress** (each can be chosen once for a given action):

* Gain **advantage** on a roll. (This may be used for an action roll or downtime roll or any other kind of roll where extra effort would help you).
* Roll **+1 effect die**. (This may be used on a damage roll or healing roll.)
* Take action while *slowed* or *stunned*.

# Heroic Blessings

The player characters are not normal and so can tap into heroic blessings that enable them to perform nigh-supernatural exploits. Heroic blessings are not related to archetypes, bloodlines, or crew. They are benefits that any player can use. Heroic blessings are represented with **Beacon Points** that a player can spend to activate a blessing. Beacon Points may be spent:

* To avoid death.
* To Act or React an additional time per round.
* To reroll with Advantage a failed roll.
* To trigger a flashback.
* Instead of taking some amount of Stress (not covered in the above).

## Resistance Roll

* In combat, spend a Reaction to make a resistance roll.
    * TIER! + ATTR! vs attack roll; or controlled, risky, or desperate target number.
* You **reduce** or **avoid** the effects of the consequence (GM chooses).
    * **Critical:** Clear 1 stress.
    * **Success:** Take 2 stress.
    * **Failure:** Take 4 stress.
    * **Botch:** Take 6 stress.

### Fortune Roll

* **Roll d20!** with **Advantage** equal to the **trait rating** versus a **controlled** (6), **risky** (11), or **desperate** (16) target number.
* **Advantage** for each Major Advantage.
* **Disadvantage** for each Major Disadvantage.
* **Critical:** Exceptional result / Great, extreme effect.
* **Success:** Good result / Standard, full effect.
* **Failure:** Mixed result / Limited, partial  effect.
* **Botch:** Bad result / Poor, little effect.


## Engagement Roll

Once the players choose a plan and provide its detail, the GM cuts to the action-describing the scene as the crew starts the operation and encounters their first obstacle. But how is this established? The way the GM describes the starting situation can have a huge impact on how simple or troublesome the operation turns out to be. Rather than expecting the GM to simply "get it right" each time, we use a dice roll instead. This is the **engagement roll**.

The engagement roll is a **fortune roll**, starting with **d20! for sheer luck**. Modify the dice pool for any major advantages or disadvantages that apply.

### Major Advantages / Disadvantages

* Is this operation particularly bold or daring? Gain Advantage. Is this operation overly complex or contingent on many factors? Roll Disadvantage.
* Does the **plan's detail** expose a vulnerability of the target or hit them where they're weakest? Gain Advantage. Is the target strongest against this approach, or do they have particular defenses or special preparations? Roll Disadvantage.
* Can any of your **friends or contacts** provide aid or insight for this operation? Gain Advantage. Are any **enemies or rivals** interfering in the operation? Roll Disadvantage.
* Are there any **other elements** that you want to consider? Maybe a lower-Tier target will give you Advantage. Maybe a higher-Tier target will give you Disadvantage. Maybe there's a situation that makes the operation more or less tricky.

The engagement roll assumes that the PCs are approaching the target as intelligently as they can, given the plan and detail they provided, so we don't need to play out tentative probing maneuvers, special precautions, or other ponderous non-action. The engagement roll covers all of that. The PCs are already in action, facing the first obstacle-up on the rooftop, picking the lock on the window; kicking down the door of the rival gang's lair; maneuvering to speak with a Lord at the masquerade party; etc.

Don't make the engagement roll and then describe the PCs *approaching* the target. It's the approach that the engagement roll resolves. Cut to the action that results *because of* that initial approach-to the first serious obstacle in their path.

**Engagement Roll**

* **d20!** for sheer luck versus **controlled**, **risky**, or **desperate** target number.
* **Advantage** for each **Major** **Advantage.**
* **Disadvantage** for each **Major** **Disadvantage.**
* **Critical:** Exceptional result. *You've already overcome the first obstacle and you're in a controlled position for what's next.*
* **Success:** Good result. *You're in a controlled position when the action starts.*
* **Failure:** Mixed result. *You're in a risky position when the action starts.*
* **Botch:** Bad result. *You're in a desperate position when the action starts.*

## Flashbacks

The rules don't distinguish between actions performed in the present moment and those performed in the past. When an operation is underway, you can invoke a **flashback** to roll for an action in the past that impacts your current situation. Maybe you convinced the district Watch sergeant to cancel the patrol tonight, so you make a Sway roll to see how that went.

The GM sets a **stress cost** when you activate a flashback action.

* 0 Stress: An ordinary action for which you had easy opportunity. *The Cutter *Consorted* with her friend to agree to arrive at the dice game ahead of time, to suddenly spring out as a surprise ally.*
* 1 Stress: A complex action or unlikely opportunity. *The Hound *Finessed* his pistols into a hiding spot near the card table so he could retrieve them after the pat-down at the front door.*
* 2 (or more) Stress: An elaborate action that involved special opportunities or contingencies. *The Whisper has already Studied the history of the property and learned of a ghost that is known to haunt its ancient canal dock-a ghost that can be compelled to reveal the location of the hidden vault.*

After the stress cost is paid, a flashback action is handled just like any other action. Sometimes it will entail an action roll, because there's some danger or trouble involved. Sometimes a flashback will entail a fortune roll, because we just need to find out how well (or how much, or how long, etc.). Sometimes a flashback won't call for a roll at all because you can just pay the stress and it's accomplished.

If a flashback involves a **downtime** activity, pay 1 coin or 1 rep for it, instead of stress.

One of the best uses for a flashback is when the **engagement roll** goes badly. After the GM describes the trouble you're in, you can call for a flashback to a special preparation you made, "just in case" something like this happened. This way, your "flashback planning" will be focused on the problems that *do* happen, not the problems that *might* happen.


### Monetary values

* 1 coin: A full purse of silver pieces. A week's wages.
* 2 coin: A fine weapon. A weekly income for a small business. A fine piece of art. A set of luxury clothes.
* 4 coin: A satchel full of silver. A month's wages.
* 6 coin: An exquisite jewel. A heavy burden of silver pieces.
* 8 coin: A good monthly take for a small business. A small safe full of coins and valuables. A very rare luxury commodity.
* 10 coin: Liquidating a significant asset-a carriage and goats, a horse, a deed to a small property.

More than 5 coin is an impractical amount to keep lying around. You must spend the excess or put it in your **stash** (see below). A crew can also store 5 coin in their lair, by default. If they upgrade to a **vault**, they can expand their stores to 10 and then 20 coin. Any coin beyond their limit must be spent as soon as possible (typically before the next score) or distributed among the crew members.

One unit of coin in silver pieces or other bulk currency takes up one item slot for your **load** when carried.

### Coin Use

* Spend 1 coin to get an additional **activity** during **downtime**.
* Spend 1 coin to increase the result level of a **downtime activity** roll.
* Spend coin to avoid certain crew **entanglements**.
* Put coin in your character's **stash** to improve their lifestyle and circumstances when they retire. See the next page.
* Spend coin when you advance your crew's **Tier**.

# Entering Combat

Determine if any creatures are Surprised --- winner of opposed **Survey** vs **Prowl** rolls. In situations where one side of the combat has no awareness of the other, simply assign *surprised*. If a creature might be aware (or you want to let the dice decide) but isn't actively watching, those creatures suffer *disadvantage* on the **Survey** check. *Surprised* creatures may not act during the first round of combat. Other creatures act normally, but **ambushing** characters act first, taking a full turn. If no creatures are *surprised*, all creatures may act normally the first round of combat.

A **round of combat** involves the following stages:

1. Each player decides if their character acts **rashly** or **cautiously** and indicates their choice.
2. All **ambushing** characters act.
3. All player characters acting **rashly** take their turns in an order decided by the players.
4. All non-player characters act in an order determined by the GM. This is called the **monster** turn.
5. All player characters acting **cautiously** take their turns in an order decided by the players.

Continue taking rounds until the combat has been decided one way or another whether that is death, defeat, surrender, ceasefire, or retreat. If the player character's decisions to act *rashly* or *cautiously* is dragging on without resolution have a non-player character take its turn.

## Actions in Combat

Each round you may **Act** twice and **React** twice. You Act during your turn, and React during other's turns.

Players must decide if their characters are going to act *rashly* or *cautiously* in each round. A character acting *rashly* may Act one fewer time and React one fewer time per round (by default, letting them Act once and React once when acting *rashly*). A character acting *cautiously* maintains their full complement of actions.

An **Act** represents the primary focus of your turn and generally involves inflicting your will onto an enemy, aiding an ally, preparing for a future turn, or moving.

* Make a basic attack.
* Advance up to your stride.
* Maneuver 5'.
* Pick up an item.
* Draw or Stow one or two Readied items.
* Make a *resistance roll* to reduce the severity of a Wound.
* Use an Action Power.

You **React** in response to the actions of another - whether this is hitting an enemy running wildly past you or interposing yourself between danger and an ally.

* Respond to Aid an ally.
* Make a *resistance roll* to avoid consequences or reduce damage.
* Use a Reaction Power.

* * * * * * *
\pagebreak

## Conditions

While **concealed**, gain +5 defense.

* *A target gains concealment versus attacks when line-of-sight from the attack's origin is partially obscured - for example by fog, a fence, or bushes - but not by something that would stop attacks.*

While **hidden**, cannot be targeted by attacks.

* *A target gains hidden versus a creature that cannot see, hear, or otherwise perceive you. When a hidden creature makes an attack against a target it is hidden from, gain advantage on the attack check and that target may not take reactions to this attack.*

While **sheltered**, gain +5 defense and resistance to all damage types.

* *A target gains sheltered versus attacks when line-of-sight from the attack's origin is partially obscured by something that would stop attacks - for example, a sturdy wall, structure, obstruction, or boulder.*

While **staggered**, current hit points are less than or equal to half maximum hit points.

* Whether or not a creature is staggered is public information.

A creature **threatens** a target in melee when the creature is able to act, wielding a melee weapon, and the target is within the range of that weapon. A target **is threatened by** creature when the creature is able to act, wielding a melee weapon, and the target is within the range of that weapon. A creature is **in melee** if it either threatens an enemy or is threatened by an enemy.

* *While in melee, a creature's non-melee, non-touch, non-adjacent attack checks suffer disadvantage. While in melee, a creature gains +5 defense against non-melee attacks targeting it. When a creature advances, if it stops being threatened by an enemy, that enemy may spend a reaction to make a basic attack targeting the advancing creature.*

## Wounds

Attacks may inflict **wounds**, **hit point damage**, or both. Each wound has a **severity** which defines its duration and how much it affects you. Instead of dealing additional damage on an attack, a critical hit may inflict a wound with severity equal to or less than the critical multiplier.

At the end of your turn, you may reduce by one the severity of a single of your wounds. If this reduces the severity to zero or less, that wound no longer afflicts you.

### Wounds and their Severity

While **bleeding** *(severity 1-5)*, if you are living, you lose HP at the beginning of your turn.

* *[d4]/[d6]/[d8]/[d10]/[d12]*

While **blighted** *(severity 1-5)*, you suffer *entropic* damage at the beginning of your turn.

* *[d4]/[d6]/[d8]/[d10]/[d12]*

While **corroding** *(severity 1-5)*, you suffer *chemical* damage at the beginning of your turn.

* *[d4]/[d6]/[d8]/[d10]/[d12]*

While **charmed** *(severity 3)*, you act on your *charmer's* behalf without unduly endangering yourself.

While **deafened** *(severity 2)*, you cannot hear and suffer disadvantage on any checks that involve sound. Checks entirely dependent upon sound automatically fail.

When **disarmed** *(severity 1)*, you have one or more items involuntarily removed from your hands.

While **exposed** *(severity 1)*, you suffer **-5 to a single defense**.

While **goaded** *(severity 1)*, you suffer suffers disadvantage on all attacks that do not include the goading creature. A creature may only be goaded by one enemy at a time, and the newest takes precedence.

While **incapacitated** *(severity 5)*, your **defense** is **6**, can take no actions, and do not threaten.

While **rooted** *(severity 3)*, you cannot voluntarily move or be pulled, pushed, or slid.

While **sickened** *(severity 3)*, you suffer *distracted* and *weakened*.

While **slowed** *(severity 2)*, you can Act and React one less time each round and do not threaten on other turns. Take **1 stress** to Act once more on your turn.

While **stunned**  *(severity 4)*, you cannot Act or React and do not threaten on other turns. Take **1 stress** to Act.

While **terrified** *(severity 3)*, you suffer disadvantage on checks while the source of your fear is present and cannot move closer to the source of that fear without taking **stress**.

While **vulnerable** *(severity 4)*, you suffer double damage from one chosen damage type. Negating damage of that type takes 1 additional **armor** box.

While **weakened** *(severity 1-5)*, you roll *-1/-2/-3/-4/-5* **effect** die.

### Other Conditions or Effects

While **flanked** *(severity 1)*, threatening enemies on opposite sides of you split your attention, and you grant advantage on attacks checks targeting you made by flanking creatures.

When **pushed** *(severity 1)*, you are involuntarily moved away from an origin.

When **slammed** *(severity 3)*, you are involuntarily and forcefully moved away from an origin. If you stop moving because you hit something else, suffer \[d10\] *kinetic* damage for every 10' moved.

While **surprised** *(severity 3)*, you suffer **-5 defense** and cannot React.

# Downtime Activities Summary

Gain **advantage** on your roll if a **friend** or **contact** helps with your downtime activity.

Acquire Asset
: Roll **TIER!** versus a **controlled** (6), **risky** (11), or **desperate** (16) target number. The result indicates the **quality** of the asset:

: Work on a **long-term project**, if you have the means. Mark segments on the clock according to your result:

* **Critical:** Two + *critical multiplier* ticks.
* **Success:** Two ticks.
* **Failure:** One tick.

Recover
: Get **treatment** to tick your **healing clock** (like a long-term project). *When you fill a clock, each harm is reduced by one level.*

# Magnitude

The magnitude table is provided as a tool to help the GM make judgment calls. It's not meant to be a rigid restriction or mathematical formula to replace those judgment calls. Use the levels as a *guideline* for setting a magnitude number that seem appropriate to you.
