- Special Abilities:
    - **Elemental Affinity (Entropic).** You may expend one box of your **special armor** to negate one consequence from an attack of a single **damage type**, or to **push yourself** to breathe destructive energy.
        - *What element do you breathe? What elements do you have an affinity for? What elements are you vulnerable to?*
        - *When you use this ability, tick one special armor box on your character sheet. If you negate a consequence, you ignore it completely. If you use this ability to push yourself, you get one of the benefits (advantage or additional effect die), but you don't take stress. Your special armor is restored at the beginning of downtime.*
        - **Elemental Breath**
            - Prerequisites: Elemental Affinity.
            - Cost: Act, 1 Special Box.
            - Target: 10' cube within 60'.
            - Attack: Utter/WILL! vs IRON.
            - Hit: (Utter)[WILL] *entropic* damage.
    - **Spellcraft.** *You know the arcane methods to conjure supernatural effects from written spells. You can **Study** a spell (or create a new one) to summon a supernatural effect. You begin with one spell already learned.*
        - *Without this special ability, written spells are only words on a page.*
        - *Follow the Spell Creation procedure with the GM to define your first spell.*
        - *The stress cost of any spells you cast is lowered by the action rating of the casting action - a 6 stress power would cost a character with Utter 2 only 4 stress.*
        - **Spell Mastery.** *Spell Mastery provides 1 + TIER + UTTER points to reduce Stress costs of Powers using UTTER by 1 for each point (not below 1).*
