- Special Abilities:
    - **Infiltrator.**
        - You are not affected by **quality** or **Tier** when you bypass security measures.
            - *This ability lets you contend with higher-Tier enemies on equal footing. When you're cracking a safe, picking a lock, or sneaking past elite guards, your effect level is never reduced due to superior Tier or quality level of your opposition.*
            - *Are you a renowned safe cracker? Do people tell stories of how you slipped under the noses of two Chief Inspectors, or are your exceptional talents yet to be discovered?*
    - **Subterfuge.**
        - You may expend **special armor** to resist a consequence from suspicion or persuasion, or to **push yourself** for subterfuge.
            - *When you use this ability, tick one of your special armor boxes on your playbook sheet. If you "resist a consequence" of the appropriate type, you avoid it completely. If you use this ability to push yourself, you get one of the benefits (advantage, +1 effect, etc.) but you don't take 1 stress. Your special armor is restored at the beginning of downtime.*
    - **Strange Methods.**
        - When you **invent** or **craft** a creation with *arcane* features, get **+1 quality level** to your roll. You begin with one arcane design already known.
            - *Follow the Inventing procedure with the GM to define your first arcane design.*
