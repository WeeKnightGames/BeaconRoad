- Special Abilities:
    - **Bodyguard.** When you **protect** a teammate, gain **Advantage** on your resistance roll. When you gather info to anticipate possible threats in the current situation, you get **+1 effect**.
        - *The protect teamwork maneuver lets you face a consequence for a teammate. If you choose to resist that consequence, this ability gives you Advantage on your resistance roll. Also, when you read a situation to gather information about hidden dangers or potential attackers, you get +1 effect-which means more detailed information.*
    - **Strapping.** Your load limits are higher, and you are not slowed by your load. Light: 5. Normal: 7. Heavy: 8.
        - *Dwarves make Mules look like weaklings.*
        - *This ability is great if you want to wear heavy armor and pack a heavy weapon without attracting lots of attention. Since your exact gear is determined on-the-fly during an operation, having more load also gives you more options to get creative with when dealing with problems during a score.*
