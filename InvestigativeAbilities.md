# Investigative Abilities

The following abilities are the bread and butter of GUMSHOE characters.
Ability descriptions consist of a brief general description, followed by examples of their use in an investigation. Creative players should be able to propose additional uses for their abilities as unexpected situations confront their characters.
Certain specific actions may overlap between a couple of abilities. For example, you can enhance image resolution with either Data Retrieval or Photography.
Some abilities, like Research, are broadly useful, and will crop up constantly. Others may be called for many times in the course of one scenario, and not at all in others. When building your character, strike a balance between the reliable workhouse abilities and their exotic, specialized counterparts.
Investigative abilities are divided into the following sub-groups: Academic, Interpersonal, and Technical. The purpose of the sub-groups is to allow you to quickly find the best ability for the task during play, by scanning the most likely portion of the overall list.

[Rewrite investigative ability descriptions and example bullet points as needed for your setting. Rename abilities for desired flavor. Create new abilities keyed to your setting. Include only abilities relevant to your setting in your game. Some investigative abilities tie into specific general abilities and vice versa; make sure you either include both relevant abilities, or drop the cross-references between them. Some abilities may subsume more specific abilities from other games; for instance, TimeWatch’s Science! includes under its aegis the abilities Astronomy, Botany, Chemistry, Natural History, and more. Where appropriate, include Sample Spends to show players what they might accomplish by spending one or more Investigative points.]

Anthropology (Academic)
You are an expert in the study of human cultures, from the stone age to the Internet age. You can:
* identify artifacts and rituals of living cultures
* describe the customs of a foreign group or local subculture
* extrapolate the practices of an unknown culture from similar examples

Archaeology (Academic)
You excavate and study the structures and artifacts of historical cultures and civilizations. You can:
* tell how long something has been buried
* identify artifacts by culture and usage
* distinguish real artifacts from fakes
* navigate inside ruins and catacombs
* describe the customs of ancient or historical cultures
* spot well-disguised graves and underground hiding places

Architecture (Academic)
You know how buildings are planned and constructed. You can:
* guess what lies around the corner while exploring an unknown structure
* judge the relative strength of building materials
* identify a building’s age, architectural style, original use, and history of modifications
* construct stable makeshift structures
* identify elements vital to a building’s structural integrity

Art History (Academic)
You’re an expert on works of art from an aesthetic and technical point of view. You can:
* distinguish real works from fakes
* tell when something has been retouched or altered
* identify the age of an object by style and materials
* call to mind historical details on artists and those around them

Astronomy (Technical)
You study celestial objects, including the stars, planets. You can:
* decipher astrological texts
* plot the movement of constellations
* study and debunk UFO reports

Authority (Interpersonal)
You know how to present yourself as the person in charge, whether that’s a CEO, a government official, a military commander, or a police officer. You speak the lingo of soldiers and law enforcement authorities, and you know how to make people feel confident and relaxed in your presence. You can:
* command the attention of people who need problems solved
* impersonate a law enforcement officer
* coolly ply cops and soldiers for confidential information
* fit in smoothly in any sort of military organization, with people assuming you’re a soldier or an officer
* get excused for minor infractions

Ballistics (Technical)
You process evidence relating to the use of firearms. You can:
* identify the caliber and type of a bullet or casing found at a crime scene
* determine if a particular gun fired a given bullet

Botany (Academic)
You study plants and fungi and can:
* identify the likely environment in which a plant sample grew
* identify plants which might be toxic, carnivorous, or otherwise dangerous
* spot the symptoms of plant-derived poisonings

Bullshit Detector (Interpersonal)
You can tell when some people are lying. You must usually be interacting with them or observing them from a close distance, but sometimes you can spot liars on television, too. Unfortunately, nearly everyone lies, especially when facing possible trouble from the authorities. Sometimes you can infer why they’re lying, but it’s hard to reliably discern motive or get at the facts they’re working to obscure. This sense doesn’t tell you what they’re lying about, specifically, or see through their lies to the truth.
Not all lies are verbal. You can tell when a person is attempting to project a false impression through body language.
Certain individuals may be so adept at lying that they never set off your bullshit detector. Some people believe their own falsehoods. Psychopathic personality types lie reflexively and without shame, depriving you of the telltale tics and gestures you use to sense when a person is deceiving you. Sometimes you need leverage to get information out of people who you know are lying – re-interviewing suspects in the light of additional facts is a genre staple.

Bureaucracy (Interpersonal)
You know how to navigate a bureaucratic organization, whether it’s a governmental office or a large business concern. You know how to get what you want from it in an expeditious manner, and with a minimum of ruffled feathers. You can:
* convince officials to provide sensitive information
* gain credentials on false pretences
* find the person who really knows what’s going on
* locate offices and files
* borrow equipment or supplies
Bureaucracy is not a catch-all information gathering ability. Bureaucrats wish to convey the impression that they are busy and harried, whether or not they actually are. Most take a profound, secret joy in directing inquiries elsewhere. When players attempt to use Bureaucracy to gain information more easily accessible via other abilities (such as Research), their contacts snidely advise them to do their own damn legwork.

Camping (Technical)
You are familiar with working and living outdoors and in the wild. You might be a farmer, cowboy, or logger, or an amateur (or professional) fisher or hunter, or work for the Park Service.
Perhaps you were merely an Eagle Scout, grew up in the back of nowhere, or served in a military unit with sufficient patrol experience “in country.” You can:
* tell when an animal is behaving strangely
* tell whether an animal or plant is natural to a given area
* find edible plants, hunt, and fish
* make fire and survive outdoors at night or in bad weather
* navigate overland, albeit more easily with a compass and a map
* track people, animals, or vehicles across grass or through forests
* hunt with dogs, including tracking with bloodhounds, assuming you have friendly dogs available

Charm (Interpersonal)
You’re good at making people want to help you, whether you utilize compliments, flattery, or flirting. You can get them to:
* reveal information
* perform minor favors
* regard you as trustworthy
* become enamored with you
[Charm combines Flattery and Flirting into one Ability, and shouldn’t be used in conjunction with them.]

Chemistry (Technical)
You’re trained in the analysis of chemical substances. You can:
* among a wide variety of other materials, identify drugs, pharmaceuticals, toxins, and viruses
* match samples of dirt or vegetation from a piece of evidence to a scene

Craft (Technical)
You can create useful physical objects, working with materials like wood, metal, jewelry, and so forth. Although the resulting cabinets, kettles, or rings may be beautiful, your focus is utility, not art. Like the Art ability, you may focus on one craft (blacksmithing, cabinetry, coopering, etc) or diversify into many; the same rules apply.
You may be able to use your Craft ability to specific investigative ends: discover a secret drawer in a desk if you are a cabinet-maker, and so forth.

Comparative Religion (Academic)
You study religions in their various forms, both ancient and modern. You can:
* supply information about religious practices and beliefs
* quote relevant tags from the major scriptures
* recognize the names and attributes of various saints, gods, and other figures of religious worship and veneration
* identify whether a given religious practice or ritual is orthodox or heretical
* fake (or in some traditions, officiate at) a religious ceremony

Cop Talk (Interpersonal)
You know how to speak the lingo of police officers, and to make them feel confident and relaxed in your presence. You may be a current or former cop, or simply the kind of person they immediately identify as a solid, trustworthy citizen. You can:
* coolly ply cops for confidential information
* get excused for minor infractions
* imply that you are a colleague, authorized to participate in their cases

Cryptography (Technical)
You’re an expert in the making and breaking of codes, from the simple ciphers of old-school espionage tradecraft to the supercomputer algorithms of the present day.

Data Retrieval (Technical)
You use computer and electronic technology to retrieve and enhance information on hard drives and other media. You can:
* recover hidden, erased or corrupted computer files
* increase the clarity of audio recordings, zeroing in on desired elements

Document Analysis (Technical)
You’re an expert in the study of physical documents. You can:
* determine a document’s approximate age
* identify the manufacturer of paper used in a document
* tell forged documents from the real thing
* identify distinctive handwriting

* find fingerprints on paper

Electronic Surveillance (Technical)
You’re adept at the use of sound recording equipment to gather evidence. You can:
* trace phone calls
* plant secret listening devices
* locate secret listening devices planted by others
* make high-quality audio recordings
* enhance the quality of audio recordings, isolating chosen sounds

Evidence Collection (Technical)
You’re adept at finding, bagging and tagging important clues. You can:
* spot objects of interest at a crime scene or other investigation site
* note relationships between objects at a crime scene, reconstructing sequences of events
* store objects for forensic analysis without contaminating your samples

Explosive Devices (Technical)
You’re an expert in bombs and booby-traps. You can:
* defuse bombs and traps
* reconstruct exploded bombs, determining their materials, manufacture, and the sophistication of the bomb-maker
* safely construct and detonate explosive devices of your own

Fingerprinting (Technical)
You’re an expert in finding, transferring and matching fingerprints. This includes expertise in the computer software used to compare sample fingerprints against large databases of criminal defendants and government personnel.

Flattery (Interpersonal)
You’re good at getting people to help you by complimenting them, as subtly or blatantly as they prefer. You can get them to:
* reveal information
* perform minor favors
* regard you as trustworthy.

Flirting (Interpersonal)
You’re adept at winning cooperation from people who find you sexually attractive. You can get them to:
* reveal information
* help you in small ways
* date you
It’s up to you whether a high rating in Flirting means that you are physically alluring, or simply exude a sexual magnetism unrelated to your looks.

Forensic Accounting (Academic)
You comb through financial data looking for irregularities. In the words made famous during Woodward and Bernstein’s investigation of the Watergate scandal, you know how to “follow the money.” You can:
* tell legitimate businesses from criminal enterprises
* spot the telltale signs of embezzlement
* track payments to their source

Forensic Anthropology (Technical)
You perform autopsies on deceased subjects to determine their cause of death. In the case of death by foul play, your examination can identify:
* the nature of the weapon or weapons used
* the presence of intoxicants or other foreign substances in the bloodstream
* the contents of the victim’s last meal
In many cases, you can reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the victim’s death from the arrangement of wounds on the body.
You also perform DNA analysis on samples found at crime scenes, matching them to samples provided by suspects.

Forensic Entomology (Technical)
You specialize in the relationship between corpses and the legions of insects who dine on them. By studying eggs and larvae in a decomposing corpse you can:
* determine approximate time of death
* identify a crime scene, in the case of a dumped body

Forensic Psychology (Academic)
You apply psychological insight to the solving of criminal cases. From the details of a crime scene, you can, based on past case studies of similar offenses, assemble a profile detailing the perpetrator’s likely personal history, age, habits and attitudes.
You can also glean useful information from simple observation of certain individual, especially as they react to pressure.

Forgery (Technical)
You fake documents, art, and identification. Given time, originals (or good copies), suitable materials, and work space, you can:
* create a false identification, license, traveling paper, or other government credential
* quickly create digital records and a false Internet history
* forge handwriting with a sample to work from
* fake a book, pamphlet, newspaper, or other published work
* forge a sculpture, painting, or other objet d’art
* artificially age paper and ink
* spot forgeries, and make intelligent deductions about the forger
* undetectably open and reseal a sealed envelope, document, pouch, or other “soft” container
* create an attractive, if somewhat uninspired, work of art on a subject of your choosing
Forgery is also useful for larger, detail-oriented investigative work. You can also use Forgery to construct a fake crime scene, or to clean up an actual crime scene so as to make it look as if no crime occurred. After secretly searching a room, the visual memory you gain from Forgery will tell you if you’ve accidentally left any item out of place.

Geology (Academic)
You are an expert on rocks, soils, minerals, and the primordial history of the Earth. You can:
* analyze soil samples, crystals, minerals, and so forth
* determine the age of a rock stratum
* date and identify fossils
* evaluate soil for agriculture or industry
* identify promising sites for oil or water wells, mines, etc
* anticipate volcanism, seismic events, avalanches, and other earth phenomena

Hacking (Technical)
You use computer and electronic technology to retrieve and enhance information on computers and other information devices, from punch cards to future-tech.
You’re also an expert in math, logic, and the making and breaking of codes. Given time and computing power, you can unravel everything from simple ciphers to the supercomputer algorithms of the future. You can:
* hack into secure computer systems to gather clues
* recover hidden, erased, or corrupted computer files
* increase the clarity of audio or video recordings, zeroing in on desired elements
* break codes in any language you can read
* deduce logic puzzles and calculate complex mathematical formulas
* use Burglary to break into particularly high-tech security systems
* use Tinkering as a computer skill, should a Hacking-related General ability test be needed for any reason (such as active opposition by an opposed hacker)

High Society (Interpersonal)
You know how to hang with the rich and famous, and how to chat them up without getting security called. You are comfortable with “old money” aristocracy, with the Davos elite, with the televised chattering classes, and with the crassest of nouveau riche vulgarians and celebutantes. Yachts, Gulfstreams, and three-star restaurants are your seeming natural habitat. You can:
* dress fashionably for any occasion
* get past the velvet rope at exclusive clubs and parties, or past the concierge at a four-star hotel
* drop brand names, allude to current trends, and generally blend in culturally with rich scenesters of all types
* identify the best wine, liquor, food, jewelry, and other luxury goods
* successfully schmooze for an introduction to, e.g., a celebrity, elected official, or financier
* recall specific or relevant gossip or news about the tastes, lifestyles, or sordid behavior of a rich or famous person
* know where and when the best parties, most culturally important openings, or other gala events in any city are due to happen
* score drugs or otherwise find the seamy side (if any) of high-society functions, happening nightclubs, etc.
* interact with the rich and famous as an accepted equal
Note that this ability does not necessarily convey any actual wealth or fame. The Director can, if she wishes, allow an agent to use family connections or a liberated Company slush fund to explain it.

History (Academic)
You’re an expert in recorded human history, with an emphasis on its political, military, and economic and technological developments. You can:
* recognize obscure historical allusions
* recall capsule biographies of famous historical figures
* tell where and when an object made during historical times was fashioned
* identify the period of an article of dress or costume
[For TimeWatch, History may be split into Ancient, Contemporary and Future abilities.]

Impersonate (Interpersonal)
You’re good at posing as another person, whether briefly misrepresenting yourself during a phone call or spending long periods undercover in a fictional identity.
Successfully disguising yourself as an actual person known to those you’re interacting with is extraordinarily difficult. Brief voice-only mimicry requires a spend of at least 1.
Face-to-face impersonation requires a spend of at least 2 to 3 points for every five minutes of sustained contact between you and the object of your impersonation. Especially wary or intelligent subjects cost more to hoodwink than dull-witted walk-on characters.

Inspiration (Interpersonal)
You convince reluctant witnesses to supply information by appealing to their better selves. After a few moments of interaction you intuitively sense the positive values they hold dearest, then invoke them in a brief but stirring speech.

Interrogation (Interpersonal)
You’re trained in extracting information from suspects and witnesses in the context of a formal police-style interview. This must take place in an official setting, where the subject is confined or feels under threat of confinement, and recognizes your authority (whether real or feigned.)

Intimidation (Interpersonal)
You elicit cooperation from suspects by seeming physically imposing, invading their personal space, and adopting a psychologically commanding manner. Intimidation may involve implied or direct threats of physical violence but is just as often an act of mental dominance. You can:
* gain information
* inspire the subject to leave the area
* quell a subject’s desire to attempt violence against you or others

Languages (Academic)
For each rating point in Languages, you are verbally fluent and literate in one language other than your native tongue. You may specify these when you create your character, or choose opportunistically in the course of play, revealing that you just happen to speak Javanese when circumstances require it. You are not learning the language spontaneously but revealing a hitherto unmentioned fact about your character. You may elect to be literate in an ancient language which is no longer spoken.

Law (Academic)
You are familiar with the criminal and civil laws of your home jurisdiction, and broadly acquainted with foreign legal systems. At a rating of 2 or more, you are a bar-certified attorney. You can:
* assess the legal risks attendant on any course of action
* understand lawyerly jargon
* argue with police and prosecutors

Linguistics (Academic)
You are an expert in the principles and structures underlying languages. You can probably speak other Languages, but that is a separate ability that must be purchased separately. You can:
* given a large enough sample of text, decipher the basic meaning of an unknown language
* identify the languages most similar to an unknown language
* identify artificial, alien and made-up languages

Locksmith (Technical)
You can open doors and locks, and disarm alarms, without benefit of the key. (You can also find convenient windows to jimmy or coal-cellar doors to force, if need be.) Many locks require specialized tools, possession of which without a locksmith’s license is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. Very complex or tricky locks may require spends to open them speedily, to avoid noise or damage, or to relock afterward.
Using Locksmith is, in other words, a way to gather clues. A lock that won’t open is like a witness that won’t talk or a bloodstain you can’t find: antithetical to mystery-solving, investigative-adventure design. Only safes, bank vaults, and the like – locks that exist to drive drama or conflict, rather than locks which merely hold clues — require actual tests against Difficulty.

Medical Expertise (Technical)
You are trained in carrying out medical examinations of living human subjects, performing autopsies on the deceased, and forming diagnoses based on your findings. With 2 or more points of Medical Expertise you are likely a trained and certified doctor. You can:
* establish a person’s general level of health
* prescribe treatment for a treatable condition
* perform autopsies
* diagnose probable causes of addiction, disease, sickness, injury, poisoning, or death
* tell if a subject is a shape-shifted nonhuman
* perform DNA analysis on subjects, identifying their likely relatives
* interact with medical professionals as a peer, understanding medical jargon and practices from throughout history

Military Tactics (Academic)
You are a student of warfare, probably trained as such in a military academy or through hard experience on a battlefield. This expertise includes a knowledge of military history, strategy, and tactics, and the weapons, technologies, and engineering techniques of the battlefield. You can:
* identify an unknown military or paramilitary force by examining the weapons, uniforms, or insignia they use
* deduce a soldier’s training and assignment history from his demeanor and use of slang and jargon
* spot weaknesses in an enemy’s fortifications or tactics
* know the key turning point of a historical battle
* deduce whether a battle is being won through the use of anachronistic technology or tactics
* analyze the effectiveness of an enemy’s battle tactics
* examine traces of a hand-to-hand skirmish and recreate the fight

Natural History (Academic)
You study the evolution, behavior, and biology of plants and animals. You can:
* tell when an animal is behaving strangely
* tell whether an animal or plant is natural to a given area
* identify an animal from samples of its hair, blood, bones or other tissue
* identify a plant from a small sample

Negotiation (Interpersonal)
You are an expert in making deals with others, convincing them that the best arrangement for you is also the best for them. You can:
* haggle for goods and services
* mediate hostage situations
* swap favors or information with others

Notice (Technical)
You are adept at noticing subtle details and finding important clues. This is the generic ability for spotting a hidden clue or a disguised imposter, maintaining general situational awareness, or noticing a nonthreatening visual anomaly. You can:
* spot hidden objects and objects of interest at an investigation site
* notice subtle errors in a disguise
* case a location to spot guards, cameras, multiple entrances, potential security response, and the like
* notice signs of a previous search of the location
* find anachronistic technology that is currently in use, or signs of future tech that has recently been used in a location
* note relationships between objects at a crime scene, reconstructing sequences of events
* cold read someone, analyzing their body language and behavior to draw conclusions about them

Occult Studies (Academic)
You’re an expert in the historical study of magic, superstition, and hermetic practice from the stone age to the present. From Satanists to the Golden Dawn, you know the dates, the places, the controversies, and the telling anecdotes. You can:
* identify the cultural traditions informing a ritual from examining its physical aftermath
* supply historical facts concerning various occult traditions
* guess the intended effect of a ritual from its physical aftermath
* identify occult activities as the work of informed practitioners, teenage posers, or bona fide Esoterrorists
Your knowledge of the occult is that of a detached, even disapproving, outsider. This ability does not allow you to work magic or summon supernatural entities. Doing either of these things is bad, the work of Esoterrorists. It weakens the fabric of reality and warps the practitioner’s psyche. You can, at best, fake your way through a ritual while attempting to pass yourself off as a believer. Even in this situation, your actions do not evoke supernatural effects. Your covertly hostile presence may, in fact, be enough to prevent an Esoterror ritual from achieving efficacy.
As mentioned earlier, all characters built for the Esoterrorist setting get Occult Studies 1 for free.

Oral History (Interpersonal)

You can find sources willing to talk, win their confidence, and gather (usually lengthy) oral testimony about historical events, local traditions, folklore, family legend, or gossip. This is an excellent way to do research in illiterate or semi-literate societies, and in rural or small-town communities in general. This ability also covers taking shorthand notes or making recordings without spooking your sources.
Against an armored enemy during a fight, spending 1 or more points of Notice might allow you to target unarmored portions of their body for several rounds, ignoring part or all of their armor when calculating damage.

Outdoor Survival (Technical)
You have lived and worked outdoors and in the wild, possibly during a rural upbringing or isolated military service. You can:
* accurately determine the weather for the next day
* tell when an animal is acting strangely
* tell whether an animal or plant is natural to a given area and time
* hunt, fish, and find edible plants
* ride a horse (using Athletics to determine how well)
* make fire and survive outdoors at night or in bad weather
* navigate overland
* track people, animals, or vehicles across grass or through forests

Pathology (Academic)
You are trained in carrying out medical examinations of living human subjects and forming diagnoses based on your findings. You can
* diagnose probable causes of sickness or injury
* identify the extent and cause of an unconscious person's trauma
* detect when a person is suffering from a physically debilitating condition such as drug addiction, pregnancy or malnutrition
* establish a person's general level of health
* identify medical abnormalities
If you have 8 or more points in Medic you get Pathology 1 for free.

Photography (Technical)
You’re proficient in the use of cameras, including still and video photography. You can:
* take useful visual records of crime scenes
* spot manual retouching or digital manipulation in a photographic or video image
* realistically retouch and manipulate images

Reassurance (Interpersonal)
You get people to do what you want by putting them at ease. You can:
* elicit information and minor favors
* allay fear or panic in others
* instill a sense of calm during a crisis

Research (Academic)
You know how to find factual information from books, records, and official sources. You’re as comfortable with a card catalog and fiche reader as with an Internet search engine. The contacts file on your personal digital assistant brims with phone numbers of exotic and useful contacts.

Respect (Interpersonal)
Your knowledge of social rituals allows you to gain information and favors with a culturally appropriate show of respect for a subject. This ability applies to subjects who consider themselves figures of authority, or who hold real or imagined power over you. By showing respect, you preserve your status as well as the subject’s.

Science! (Technical)
You’re a scientific and engineering expert, knowledgeable about astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, and other forms of science. If you have 1 or more points in this ability you may use the General ability Tinkering to fix advanced, high-tech machinery that the GM might otherwise not let you repair.
This ability does not cover chronal mechanics, which fall under the ability Timecraft. Computer-related knowledge falls under the ability Hacking.
You can:
* quickly develop theories and conclusions about scientific phenomena
* make rapid mathematical calculations and determine orbital mechanics
* identify drugs and synthesize most chemical compounds if given an adequate laboratory
* determine the usage of mysterious scientific equipment or control panels in an unfamiliar ship or laboratory

Spying (Technical)
You’re adept with the art of spying, including spycraft, countersigns, safe houses, electronic surveillance, and the use of surreptitious photographic and sound-recording equipment. Using either your tether or contemporary technology, you can:
* trace phone calls
* hijack security cameras
* plant secret listening devices, and locate devices planted by others
* make and enhance high-quality visual records and audio recordings
* realistically manipulate audio, photographs, or video images
* ensure with some certainty that you are not being spied upon
* pass as a spy, whether to someone looking to hire a spy or to an actual agent in the intelligence community

Streetwise (Interpersonal)
You know how to behave among crooks, gang-bangers, druggies, hookers and other habitués of the criminal underworld. You can:
* deploy criminal etiquette to avoid fights and conflicts
* identify unsafe locations and dangerous people
* gather underworld rumors

Taunt (Interpersonal)
You are an expert at infuriating others, driving them to such fury that they let their secrets slip. This may be accomplished through sarcasm, disdain, mocking, insults, or public humiliation.
However you manage it, you know how to make people angry enough to talk before thinking, and you know how to steer the conversation once you do. You can:
* gain clues by making a subject too angry to think straight
* drive an antagonist into a furious monologue
* know when a threat is sincere, and when it’s just posturing
* cause a supporting character to boast about her plans while insulting or threatening you in return
* make a subject desire to attempt violence against you or others

Tradecraft (Interpersonal)
You know how to utilize the techniques of conventional espionage agents, and how to talk to them if you must hold a meet. You can:
* set up and check a dead drop
* spot or conduct a brush pass or car toss
* determine which agency trained a covert operative by examining his tradecraft, surveillance methods, etc.
* identify good places for recognition signs, cleaning passes, etc.
* recall notorious or relevant episodes of spying, covert ops, etc.
* gather rumors in the covert ops world
* make contact with operatives without scaring them off
* convey information or threats elliptically without tipping off eavesdroppers

Textual Analysis (Academic)
By studying the content of texts (as opposed to their physical characteristics of documents) you can draw reliable inferences about their authorship. You can:
* determine if an anonymous text is the work of a known author, based on samples of his work
* determine the era in which a text was written
* identify the writer’s region, and level of education
* tell a real work by an author from a false one

Traffic Analysis (Technical)
You know how to boil down a mass of data — probably raw signals intel, a tranche of phone records, or possibly a whole lot of surveillance tapes — and extract its meaning and patterns. Given the data, you can:
* determine which numbers in a set of phone records are calling who, when, about what
* determine which cars in a city’s traffic pattern are driving where, when, and how long they’re staying there
* find patterns in the data flow, e.g., more murders in August, or the same museum guard on duty during all the incidents
* work out the daily (and weekly, monthly, etc.) routine of an office, military base, museum, etc. and answer questions like: When is payroll made? Who takes delivery of parcels? When does the cleaning staff arrive?
* find anomalies in the data flow, e.g., missing records or “dogs that didn’t bark”
* find weak spots in security that follows a regular pattern
* identify the source of information (or disinformation) by tracking its route through the system
* assemble a communications or organizational picture of a social network such as a criminal conspiracy, academic email list, or division of border guards

Trivia (Academic)
You’re a font of apparently useless information that would stand you in good stead as a contestant on a quiz show. You’re especially good in the following spheres of interest:
* celebrities and entertainment
* sports records and statistics
* geography
* arts and letters
* names in the news
This catch-all ability also allows you to know any obscure fact not covered by another GUMSHOE ability. (In moments of improvisatory desperation, your GM may allow you to overlap with abilities which none of the players at the current session possess, or which no one is thinking to use.)
