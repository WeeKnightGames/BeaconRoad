* What is Beacon Road about?
  * Beacon Road is about a character learning to master themselves and "impose" themselves on the world around them. Beacon Road is about learning the world is darker than you thought, but that you can be a better influence than you imagined. Beacon Road is about a “crew” doing “something”. Beacon Road is about a small crew finding their place among the powers of the world and learning to express themselves through Word.
* In what ways is your game about those things?

* Design Goals
  * I want the "things" the game is about to be mechanically incentivised.
    * If something matters (in the game), there should be a mechanical reward or penalty.
  * If, as a player, I care more about what I’m doing now, like if I really want to open this lock; there should be a mechanical way to represent that decision.
    * Expend some resource to accomplish that.
    * Handled by **pushing yourself** and taking **stress**.
  * What are the things the game is about?
    * You can push yourself beyond normal limits. (pushing yourself with stress)
    * You are a part of something bigger than yourself. (faction)
    * You have the capacity for good and evil (vice and virtue).
  * What is the game not about?
    * Fiddly things - tracking copper.
