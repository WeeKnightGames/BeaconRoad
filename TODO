Open Tasks and Ideas for Beacon Road Core Rules:

I want Beacon Road to be able to handle D&D-style adventure romps, LOTR-style epics, Blades-style city underbelly stuff.

NAMES:
 [x] Rename Crew to Faction and Chapter. @done (18-05-10 00:25)

TODO:
 [x] +1/-1 Tier, +1/-1 Effect instead of Advantage/Edge vs Disadvantage/Snag @done (18-05-15 22:29)
 [ ] All caps is dice? Or all caps is "number" - either dots, rating, or dice?
 [ ] Carouse sucks. Make it downtime action for cheaper stress?
 [ ] Give Hunter/Rogue pet that uses Command
 [ ] I have little idea of how to get Exemplify Virtue and Indulge Vice to work well in the game, but V&V is a good representation of the dividing line between good and evil running through the heart of every man so I want to keep it.
 [x] Rate Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Attributes for 3, 2, 1 Action dots in each. @done (18-05-04 11:02)
 [x] Well-made items take 1 less Load @done (18-05-04 11:02)
 [ ] Once per session, if a Character Exemplifies their Virtue or Indulges their Vice, GM, you may allow them to regain 1 Stress.
 [ ] Off-Hand Strike - 2nd attack may be made for 1 Stress if 1st misses.
 [ ] Rogue - Blackguard
 [ ] Rogue - Keeper - Hunt +1, Survey +1, Utter +2.
 [ ] Technician - Engineer +1 Finesse, +1 Study, +2 Survey. **Artificer.**
 [ ] Technician - Physician +2 Finesse, +2 Study. **Sawbones.**
 [ ] Warrior - **Berserker.** +2 Wreck, +2 Hunt. **Deadly.**
 [ ] Wizard - **Adept.** +1 Prowl, +1 Survey, +2 Command. **Meditation.**

 [x] d10 Vice, d6 Virtue ? @done (18-05-09 20:50)
 [ ] Resistance Roll is Action Roll?
 [x] Fill out Character Creation. @done (18-05-03 21:24)
 [-] Reduce Ranges and use stacking Disadvantage to balance? @cancelled (18-05-15 21:26)
 [ ] Mooks, Veterans, Bosses
   [ ] Hit against Mook kills (rounded up) number of Mooks based on HP Threshold---Mook with threshold of 4: 3 damage kills 1, 4 damage kills 1, 5 damage kills 2, etc.
   [ ] Troops/Veterans have HP like "normal"
   [ ] Bosses have HP and other things. Like Boss might only have 30 HP but take at least 3 hits or 1 hit in 3 rounds.
 [ ] Cohorts show up as Mooks in battle.
 [ ] Cohort Quality Level determines their Action Rating appropriate ones---like Thug QL determines Skirmish Rating?
 [ ] Experts usually don't show up in battle---but would as Veterans. Likely.
 [ ] I realized I can, if I want to, incorporate Gumshoe into BR by adding "Investigative Abilities/Skills/Specialties" that a player can use to obtain core clues and when a player wants more information make an Action Roll as normal.
 [ ] How to handle Ranged Attacks in Melee? Disadvantage? Cannot make them. If target someone not in Melee, those in Melee can make Reaction Strikes?
 [x] Cut Heat and Wanted Level? @done (18-05-09 20:53)
 [ ] Resistance against any type in attack works, Immunity needs all types in attack
 [ ] Religion Curses, Blessings, After-life, Eschatology, Soteriology, Perspectives on other Religions
 [ ] Bloodline and archetype perspectives on other bloodlines and archetypes?
 [ ] Some Powers/Weapons/whatever deal permanent wounds?
 [ ] Rework XP Triggers
   [ ] Getting rid of "end of session XP triggers"
   [ ] Voluntarily Botch (which gives GM Botch Point) and gain Beacon Point and 1 XP. If triggered by Virtue or Vice, relieve 1 Stress.
 [ ] GM Section
   [ ] Beginning a Campaign
     [ ] Remember to ask: Tell me one thing that is true about Trolls/Warriors/etc. in this world.
   [ ] Write up Cult of the Ascendent Flame introductory adventure.
